  abstract = {One of the problems often associated with online anonymity is that it hinders social accountability, as substantiated by the high levels of cybercrime. Although identity cues are scarce in cyberspace, individuals often leave behind textual identity traces. In this study we proposed the use of stylometric analysis techniques to help identify individuals based on writing style. We incorporated a rich set of stylistic features, including lexical, syntactic, structural, content-specific, and idiosyncratic attributes. We also developed the Writeprints technique for identification and similarity detection of anonymous identities. Writeprints is a Karhunen-Loeve transforms-based technique that uses a sliding window and pattern disruption algorithm with individual author-level feature sets. The Writeprints technique and extended feature set were evaluated on a testbed encompassing four online datasets spanning different domains: email, instant messaging, feedback comments, and program code. Writeprints outperformed benchmark techniques, including SVM, Ensemble SVM, PCA, and standard Karhunen-Loeve transforms, on the identification and similarity detection tasks with accuracy as high as 94\% when differentiating between 100 authors. The extended feature set also significantly outperformed a baseline set of features commonly used in previous research. Furthermore, individual-author-level feature sets generally outperformed use of a single group of attributes.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study aims to present the impact of using leaded avgas in piston-prop aircraft, in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach Increasing air traffic directly increases the total amount of consumed aviation fuels (kerosene or avgas). The number of aircraft and traffic that will increase soon will further increase fuel consumption. For this reason, aircraft power generation methods (long term) must be changed or the fuel must be improved (short term). The avgas used in piston-prop aircraft is known to contain lead and as a result, the production or consumption of avgas has adverse effects on human health, the ecosystem quality and resources. Findings The overall human health impact, ecosystem quality impact and resource impact in Turkey were determined to be 2.83 disability-adjusted life years, 1.21 × 10−04 species.yr and \$138, respectively. According to the results, although the normalized total effect of Turkey was calculated as 208.18 nkg, 43.89\% of the total was observed in the Marmara region. Originality/value The originality is the use of real-time values for all calculations. For the purpose of showing the most impacted or damaged regions in Turkey via a life cycle analysis, a new definition, the normalized total effect in nkg, is defined in this study.},

  abstract = {A few studies have found associations between the exposure to traffic-related air pollution at school and/or home and cognitive development. The impact on cognitive development of the exposure to air pollutants during commuting has not been explored. We aimed to assess the role of the exposure to traffic-related air pollutants during walking commute to school on cognitive development of children. We performed a longitudinal study of children (n~=~1,234, aged 7–10~y) from 39 schools in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) who commuted by foot to school. Children were tested four times during a 12-month follow-up to characterize their developmental trajectories of working memory (d’ of the three-back numbers test) and inattentiveness (hit reaction time standard error of the Attention Network Test). Average particulate matter ≤2.5~μm (PM2.5), Black Carbon (BC) and NO2 concentrations were estimated using Land Use Regression for the shortest walking route to school. Differences in cognitive growth were evaluated by linear mixed effects models with age-by-pollutant interaction terms. Exposure to PM2.5 and BC from the commutes by foot was associated with a reduction in the growth of working memory (an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 and BC concentrations decreased the annual growth of working memory by 5.4 (95\% CI [-10.2, -0.6]) and 4.6 (95\% CI [-9.0, -0.1]) points, respectively). The findings for NO2 were not conclusive and none of the pollutants were associated with inattentiveness. Efforts should be made to implement pedestrian school pathways through low traffic streets in order to increase security and minimize children's exposure to air pollutants.},

  abstract = {The 1997 re-identification of Massachusetts Governor William Weld’s medical data within an insurance data set which had been stripped of direct identifiers has had a profound impact on the development of de-identification provisions within the 2003 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. Weld’s re-identification, purportedly achieved through the use of a voter registration list from Cambridge, MA is frequently cited as an example that computer scientists can re-identify individuals within de-identified data with “astonishing ease”. However, a careful re-examination of the population demographics in Cambridge indicates that Weld was most likely re-identifiable only because he was a public figure who experienced a highly publicized hospitalization rather than there being any certainty underlying his re-identification using the Cambridge voter data, which had missing data for a large proportion of the population.},

  abstract = {Low cost sensors for measuring atmospheric pollutants are experiencing  an increase in popularity worldwide among practitioners, academia and environmental agencies, and a large amount of data by these devices are being delivered to the public. Notwithstanding their behaviour, performance and reliability are not yet fully investigated and understood. In the present study we investigate the medium term performance of a set of NO and NO2 electrochemical sensors in Switzerland using three different regression algorithms within a field calibration approach. In order to mimic a realistic application of these devices, the sensors were initially co-located at a rural regulatory monitoring site for a 4-month calibration period, and subsequently deployed for 4 months at two distant regulatory urban sites in traffic and urban background conditions, where the performance of the calibration algorithms was explored. The applied algorithms were Multivariate Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest; these were tested, along with the sensors, in terms of generalisability, selectivity, drift, uncertainty, bias, noise and suitability for spatial mapping intra-urban pollution gradients with hourly resolution. Results from the deployment at the urban sites show a better performance of the non-linear algorithms (Support Vector Regression and Random Forest) achieving RMSE {$<$} 5 ppb, R2 between 0.74 and 0.95 and MAE between 2 and 4 ppb. The combined use of both NO and NO2 sensor output in the estimate of each pollutant showed some contribution by NO sensor to NO2 estimate and vice-versa. All algorithms exhibited a drift ranging between 5 and 10 ppb for Random Forest and 15 ppb for Multivariate Linear Regression at the end of the deployment. The lowest concentration correctly estimated, with a 25 \% relative expanded uncertainty, resulted in ca. 15-20 ppb and was provided by the non-linear algorithms. As an assessment for the suitability of the tested sensors for a targeted application, the probability of resolving hourly concentration difference in cities was investigated. It was found that NO concentration differences of 5-10 ppb (8-10 for NO2) can reliably be detected (90 \% confidence), depending on the air pollution level. The findings of this study, although derived from a specific sensor type and sensor model, are based on a flexible methodology and have extensive potential for exploring the performance of other low cost sensors, that are different in their target pollutant and sensing technology.},

  abstract = {Several studies have shown a decline in human semen quality and increased risks of male subfertility. This paper provides an overview of the mechanisms of pesticide-induced reproductive toxicity and the effects on male fertility since exposure to pesticides may be one of the causes of these disorders. Pesticides may directly damage spermatozoa, alter Sertoli cell or Leydig cell function, or disrupt the endocrine function in any stage of hormonal regulation (hormone synthesis, release, storage, transport, and clearance; receptor recognition and binding; thyroid function; and the central nervous system). These mechanisms are described with respect to the effects of pesticide exposure in vitro and in vivo. In epidemiologie studies, effects on sperm quality and time to pregnancy are reviewed. Clear effects on male fertility have been demonstrated for some pesticides [eg, dibromochloropropane, ethylene dibromide]. But results from more recent studies are inconsistent, and no uniform conclusion can be drawn about the effects of pesticides on male reproduction.}

  abstract = {Measurement of ambient NO2 concentrations using diffusion tube samplers is widespread in many countries, particularly in the UK. A National Network of NO2 diffusion tube samplers has been operational at over 1200 sites in the UK for over 5 years. Some previous studies have indicated that NO2 diffusion tube samplers may overestimate NO2 concentrations by up to 30\%, whereas others have shown an underestimation. Hence, the UK Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions commissioned this large-scale validation study. In this study diffusion tubes were exposed at 17 urban background monitoring sites equipped with chemiluminescent NO2 monitors within the UK Automatic Urban Monitoring Network. Over a one year period, diffusion tubes were exposed for 2- and 4-week periods, blacked out or clear and sheltered (from the wind) or unsheltered, in order to investigate the effect of a number of possible variables. The results of the study show that overall average NO2 concentrations calculated from diffusion tube measurements are likely to be within 10\% of chemiluminescent measurement data. The uncertainty on this average difference is ±24–38\% for individual diffusion tube measurements, but reduces to ±10–18\% for annual averages. Differences due to the exposure period and exposure procedure were found, but these were not large.},

  abstract = {Since aviation gasoline is now the largest remaining source of lead (Pb) emissions to the air in the United States, there is increased interest by regulatory agencies and the public in assessing the impacts on residents living in close proximity to these sources. An air quality modeling approach using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) was developed and evaluated for estimating atmospheric concentrations of Pb at and near general aviation airports where leaded aviation gasoline (avgas) is used. These detailed procedures were made to accurately characterize emissions and dispersion leading to improved model performance for a pollutant with concentrations that vary rapidly across short distances. The new aspects of this work included a comprehensive Pb emission inventory that incorporated sub-daily time-in-mode (TIM) activity data for piston-engine aircraft, aircraft-induced wake turbulence, plume rise of the aircraft exhaust, and allocation of approach and climb-out emissions to 50-m increments in altitude. To evaluate the modeling approach used here, ambient Pb concentrations were measured upwind and downwind of the Santa Monica Airport (SMO) and compared to modeled air concentrations. Modeling results paired in both time and space with monitoring data showed excellent overall agreement (absolute fractional bias of 0.29 winter, 0.07 summer). The modeling results on individual days show Pb concentration gradients above the urban background concentration of 10~ng~m−3 extending downwind up to 900~m from the airport, with a crosswind extent of 400~m. Three-month average modeled concentrations above the background were found to extend to a maximum distance of approximately 450~m beyond the airport property in summer and fall. Modeling results show aircraft engine “run-up” is the most important source contribution to the maximum Pb concentration. Sensitivity analysis shows that engine run-up time, Pb concentration in avgas, and the fraction of piston-engine aircraft that are twin-engine are the most important parameters in determining near-field Pb concentrations. Year-long air quality modeling for 2008 and sensitivity analysis for the maximum 3-month average concentration period suggest the potential for 3-month average Pb concentrations that exceed the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Lead (0.15~μg~m−3). The modeling methodology used in this analysis is generally transferable to other general aviation single runway airports in coastal environments of which there are over 1700 in the United States. This modeling approach can also be used to evaluate the air quality improvements from various emission reduction measures.},

  abstract = {Traffic-related air pollution in urban areas contributes significantly to commuters’ daily PM2.5 exposures, but varies widely depending on mode of commuting. To date, studies show conflicting results for PM2.5 exposures based on mode of commuting, and few studies compare multiple modes of transportation simultaneously along a common route, making inter-modal comparisons difficult. In this study, we examined breathing zone PM2.5 exposures for six different modes of commuting (bicycle, walking, driving with windows open and closed, bus, and light-rail train) simultaneously on a single 2.7 km (1.68 mile) arterial urban route in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) during peak “rush hour” times. Using previously published minute ventilation rates, we estimated the inhaled dose and exposure rate for each mode of commuting. Mean PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 5.20 μg/m3 for driving with windows closed to 15.21 μg/m3 for driving with windows open. The estimated inhaled doses over the 2.7 km route were 6.83 μg for walking, 2.78 μg for cycling, 1.28 μg for light-rail train, 1.24 μg for driving with windows open, 1.23 μg for bus, and 0.32 μg for driving with windows closed. Similarly, the exposure rates were highest for cycling (18.0 μg/hr) and walking (16.8 μg/hr), and lowest for driving with windows closed (3.7 μg/hr). Our findings support previous studies showing that active commuters receive a greater PM2.5 dose and have higher rates of exposure than commuters using automobiles or public transportation. Our findings also support previous studies showing that driving with windows closed is protective against traffic-related PM2.5 exposure.},

  abstract = {Few studies have investigated the associations between ambient air pollution and mental disorders (MDs), especially in developing countries. We conducted a time-series study to explore the associations between six criteria air pollutants and daily hospital admissions for MDs in Shanghai, China, from 2013 to 2015. The MDs data were derived from the Shanghai Health Insurance System. We used over-dispersed, generalized additive models to estimate the associations after controlling for time trend, weather conditions, day of the week, and holidays. In addition, we evaluated the effect of modification by age, sex, and season. A total of 39,143 cases of hospital admissions for MDs were identified during the study period. A 10-μg/m3 increase in 2-day, moving-average concentration of inhalable particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide was significantly associated with increments of 1.27\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.28\%, 2.26\%], 6.88\% (95\% CI, 2.75\%, 11.00\%), and 0.16\% (95\% CI: 0.02\%, 0.30\%) in daily hospital admissions for MDs, respectively. We observed positive but insignificant associations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. The estimated association of SO2 was relatively robust to the adjustment of simultaneous exposure to other pollutants. We found generally stronger associations of air pollutants with MDs in warm seasons than in cool seasons. There were no significant differences in the associations between different sex and age groups. This study suggested that short-term exposure to air pollution, especially to sulfur dioxide, was associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for MDs in Shanghai, China.},

The contribution of unleaded gasoline has not been sufficiently recognized; therefore, we evaluated the impact of Pb from unleaded gasoline in a relatively pristine area in Subarctic NE Norway. The influence of different endmembers (Ni slag and concentrate from the Nikel smelter in Russia, PM10 filters, and traffic) on the overall Pb emissions was determined using various environmental samples (snow, lichens, and topsoils) and Pb isotope tracing. We found a strong relationship between Pb in snow and the Ni smelter. However, lichen samples and most of the topsoils were contaminated by Pb originating from the current use of unleaded gasoline originating from Russia. Historical leaded and recent unleaded gasoline are fully distinguishable using Pb isotopes, as unleaded gasoline is characterized by a low radiogenic composition (206Pb/207Pb~=~1.098 and 208Pb/206Pb~=~2.060) and remains an unneglectable source of Pb in the region.},

In this study, the exposure to pesticide residues through fruit and vegetable consumption is evaluated based on the 2008 surveillance data of the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC). Results (deterministic and probabilistic approach) demonstrate that the chronic exposure of the adult population ({$>$}15 years) is generally under control, even at high or frequent consumption of fruit and vegetables. For most of the pesticide residues studied, the exposure is one hundred times lower than the ‘acceptable daily intake’ or ADI. With regard to children (2–5 years) who consume regularly or large amounts of fruit and vegetables, there are however, indications that for some pesticides the ADI can be exceeded. Nevertheless, due to the large uncertainty in these calculations, a more detailed study is required for this vulnerable group of consumers. In addition, it was demonstrated that washing and peeling of fruit and vegetables result in an exposure that is probably five to six times lower.},

The oldest available record is Homer’s mention (about 1000 B.C.) that Odysseus burned sulfur “…to purge the hall and the house and the court” (Odyssey XXII, 492–494). Pliny the Elder (23 to 79 A.D.) collected in his Natural History many anecdotes on the use of pesticides in the previous three or four centuries (Shepard, 1939). Dioscorides, a Greek physician (40 to 90 A.D.) knew of the toxic properties of sulfur and of arsenic. There are records showing that by 900 A.D. the Chinese were using arsenic sulfides to control garden insects. Veratrurn album and v. nigrum, two species of false hellebore, were used by the Romans as rodenticides (Shepard, 1939). In 1669, the earliest known record of arsenic as an insecticide in the Western World mentioned its use with honey as an ant bait. Use of tobacco as contact insecticide for plant lice was mentioned later in the same century. Cbpper compounds were known since 1807 to have fungicidal value, and the Bordeaux mixture (hydrated lime and copper sulfate) was first used in France in 1883. Hydrocyanic acid, known to the Egyptians and the Romans as a poison, was used as a fumigant in 1877 to kill museum pests in insect collections (Shepard, 1939). Carbon disulfide has been used as an insect fumigant since 1854.},

  abstract = {A fast-growing area of research is the development of low-cost sensors for measuring air pollutants. The affordability and size of low-cost particle sensors makes them an attractive option for use in experiments requiring a number of instruments such as high-density spatial mapping. However, for these low-cost sensors to be useful for these types of studies their accuracy and precision need to be quantified. We evaluated the Alphasense OPC-N2, a promising low-cost miniature optical particle counter, for monitoring ambient airborne particles at typical urban background sites in the UK. The precision of the OPC-N2 was assessed by co-locating 14 instruments at a site to investigate the variation in measured concentrations. Comparison to two different reference optical particle counters as well as a TEOM-FDMS enabled the accuracy of the OPC-N2 to be evaluated. Comparison of the OPC-N2 to the reference optical instruments shows some limitations for measuring mass concentrations of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10. The OPC-N2 demonstrated a significant positive artefact in measured particle mass during times of high ambient RH ({$>$}85\%) and a calibration factor was developed based upon °-Köhler theory, using average bulk particle aerosol hygroscopicity. Application of this RH correction factor resulted in the OPC-N2 measurements being within 33\% of the TEOM-FDMS, comparable to the agreement between a reference optical particle counter and the TEOM-FDMS (20\%). Inter-unit precision for the 14 OPC-N2 sensors of 22±13\% for PM10 mass concentrations was observed. Overall, the OPC-N2 was found to accurately measure ambient airborne particle mass concentration provided they are (i) correctly calibrated and (ii) corrected for ambient RH. The level of precision demonstrated between multiple OPC-N2s suggests that they would be suitable devices for applications where the spatial variability in particle concentration was to be determined.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The environments in which we live, work, and play are subject to enormous variability in air pollutant concentrations. To adequately characterize air quality (AQ), measurements must be fast (real time), scalable, and reliable (with known accuracy, precision, and stability over time). Lower-cost air-quality-sensor technologies offer new opportunities for fast and distributed measurements, but a persistent characterization gap remains when it comes to evaluating sensor performance under realistic environmental sampling conditions. This limits our ability to inform the public about pollution sources and inspire policy makers to address environmental justice issues related to air quality. In this paper, initial results obtained with a recently developed lower-cost air-quality-sensor system are reported. In this project, data were acquired with the ARISense integrated sensor package over a 4.5-month time interval during which the sensor system was co-located with a state-operated (Massachusetts, USA) air quality monitoring station equipped with reference instrumentation measuring the same pollutant species. This paper focuses on validating electrochemical (EC) sensor measurements of CO, NO, NO\textsubscript{2}, and O\textsubscript{3} at an urban neighborhood site with pollutant concentration ranges (parts per billion by volume, ppb; 5min averages, ±1\emph{σ}): [CO] = 231±116ppb (spanning 84–1706ppb), [NO] = 6.1±11.5ppb (spanning 0–209ppb), [NO\textsubscript{2}] = 11.7±8.3ppb (spanning 0–71ppb), and [O\textsubscript{3}] = 23.2±12.5ppb (spanning 0–99ppb). Through the use of high-dimensional model representation (HDMR), we show that interference effects derived from the variable ambient gas concentration mix and changing environmental conditions over three seasons (sensor flow-cell temperature = 23.4±8.5°C, spanning 4.1 to 45.2°C; and relative humidity = 50.1±15.3\%, spanning 9.8–79.9\%) can be effectively modeled for the Alphasense CO-B4, NO-B4, NO2-B43F, and Ox-B421 sensors, yielding (5min average) root mean square errors (RMSE) of 39.2, 4.52, 4.56, and 9.71ppb, respectively. Our results substantiate the potential for distributed air pollution measurements that could be enabled with these sensors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Since dental plaque reservoirs of fluoride (F), calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphorus (Pi) are susceptible to decreases in pH, this in situ crossover study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the low concentration of these ions in plaque, formed in the presence of sucrose, could be attributed merely to the fermentation of this sugar. Eleven volunteers wore palatal appliances containing 6 human enamel blocks during two stages. In each stage, the treatments were either 20\% sucrose solution or distilled deionized water, which were dripped onto the blocks 8 times a day. After 28 days, in each stage, the dental plaque formed on two blocks was collected, the treatment was inverted and after a further 24 and 48 h, the biofilm formed was collected from the other blocks. The concentration of acid-soluble F, Ca and Pi, and the concentration of insoluble polysaccharide (IP) were determined in the dental plaque. Statistically lower concentrations of F, Ca and Pi, and a higher concentration of IP were found in the 28-day biofilm formed in the presence of sucrose than in its absence; after the treatment inversion the change in F, Ca and Pi was not statistically significant, but the IP concentration changed significantly. The hypothesis was rejected because change in concentration of F, Ca and Pi is not due to fermentation of the sucrose.},

  abstract = {In many countries, road traffic is one of the main sources of air pollution associated with adverse effects on human health and environment. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is considered to be a measure of traffic-related air pollution, with concentrations tending to be higher near highways, along busy roads, and in the city centers, and the exceedances are mainly observed at measurement stations located close to traffic. In order to assess the air quality in the city and the air pollution impact on public health, air quality models are used. However, firstly, before the model can be used for these purposes, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the dispersion modelling as one of the most widely used method. The monitoring and dispersion modelling are two components of air quality monitoring system (AQMS), in which statistical comparison was made in this research. The evaluation of the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS-Urban) was made by comparing monthly modelled NO2 concentrations with the data of continuous air quality monitoring stations in Kaunas city. The statistical measures of model performance were calculated for annual and monthly concentrations of NO2 for each monitoring station site. The spatial analysis was made using geographic information systems (GIS). The calculation of statistical parameters indicated a good ADMS-Urban model performance for the prediction of NO2. The results of this study showed that the agreement of modelled values and observations was better for traffic monitoring stations compared to the background and residential stations.},

  abstract = {Background Transport microenvironments tend to have higher air pollutant concentrations than other settings most people encounter in their daily lives. The choice of travel modes may affect significantly individuals' exposures; however such considerations are typically not accounted for in exposure assessment used in environmental health studies. In particular, with increasing interest in the promotion of active travel, health impact studies that attempt to estimate potential adverse consequences of potential increased pollutant inhalation during walking or cycling have emerged. Such studies require a quantification of relative exposures in travel modes. Methods The literature on air pollution exposures in travel microenvironments in Europe was reviewed. Studies which measured various travel modes including at least walking or cycling in a simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous design were selected. Data from these studies were harmonized to allow for a quantitative synthesis of the estimates. Ranges of ratios and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of air pollution exposure between modes and between background and transportation modes were estimated. Results Ten studies measuring fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP), and/or carbon monoxide (CO) in the walk, bicycle, car and/or bus modes were included in the analysis. Only three reported on CO and BC and results should be interpreted with caution. Pedestrians were shown to be the most consistently least exposed of all across studies, with the bus, bicycle and car modes on average 1.3 to 1.5 times higher for PM2.5; 1.1 to 1.7 times higher for UFP; and 1.3 to 2.9 times higher for CO; however the 95\% CI included 1 for the UFP walk to bus ratio. Only for BC were pedestrians more exposed than bus users on average (bus to walk ratio 0.8), but remained less exposed than those on bicycles or in cars. Car users tended to be the most exposed (from 2.9 times higher than pedestrians for BC down to similar exposures to cyclists for UFP on average). Bus exposures tended to be similar to that of cyclists (95\% CI including 1 for PM2.5, CO and BC), except for UFP where they were lower (ratio 0.7). Conclusion A quantitative method that synthesizes the literature on air pollution exposure in travel microenvironments for use in health impact assessments or potentially for epidemiology was conducted. Results relevant for the European context are presented, showing generally greatest exposures in car riders and lowest exposure in pedestrians.},

However, little has been written specifically about urban forests' role in urban tourism development. Based on data collected from Savannah, GA, this article develops a structural equation model to explore the linkages among urban forest appeals, city beauty, tourism experience, tourism satisfaction, and destination loyalty. The results indicate that urban forests can positively and significantly contribute to the enhancement of city beauty and enrichment of tourist experience, which, in turn, positively and significantly contributes to tourism satisfaction, which can significantly lead to destination loyalty. This study also finds that urban forests not only function as a main attractor for most visitors, but also serve to complement other tourism attractions (i.e., historical sites) in the city.},

As a ubiquitous heavy metal, lead is used in multiple applications and nine billion tons continue to be extracted globally every year. Although the United States has succeeded in limiting lead exposure among its own citizens by banning the use of lead in gasoline and household paint, while instituting improved working conditions for those who are exposed to lead in the workplace, the battle against lead is not won. In addition, it continues to plague the rest of the world today; the United States has played an increasing role in the world's exposure to lead and plans to stop are currently stalled. The year 2011 marked the centennial celebration of the life's work of Dr. Alice Hamilton in exposing lead poisoning among industrial workers in Chicago, Illinois. Her legacy provides us with the opportunity to look back and reevaluate our leaded history in the US. It also reminds us that there is more to be done to mitigate lead poisoning both domestically and in the developing world.},

  abstract = {Thecolica Pictonum or colic of Poitou, under these and many other names, was a frequent, widespread, and deadly disease from Roman times until the eighteenth century. Its unique pathognomonic, notably a severe colic succeeded by paralysis and other central nervous system dysfunction, makes it possible to identify the disease with certainty as chronic lead disease, usually caused by the ingestion of lead-adulterated wines. The custom of sweetening and preserving sour wines with lead-containing additives is traced to the Romans. They had made the empirical discovery that sapa, a syrup prepared by concentrating must in a lead vessel, kept wine from spoiling and that it had, moreover, an agreeable flavour.Reports of outbreaks of the colica Pictonum appear in the medical literature from Roman times, but the correct aetiology of the disease was not discovered until the seventeenth century following a series of outbreaks in Southern Germany which were related to unfavourable climatic and political conditions. The connexion between the disease and prevailing methods for “correcting” wines was drawn in 1696 by Eberhard Gockel, then the city physician of Ulm. This achievement can be traced to his familiarity with Samuel Stockhausen's work on plumbism among miners and potters, as well as to the favourable epidemiological situation presented by Gockel's monastic patients.From the literary evidence assembled here and from experimental determinations of the lead content of sapa and similar concentrates, it is possible to estimate the lead levels and toxicity of wines from various eras. The levels range up to 80 mg/l and make it apparent that many wines were sufficiently toxic to account for the incidence and severity of the colica Pictonum. Explanations for the disastrous persistence of the colic of Poitou are discussed, as are the similarities between Gockel's approach and the methods of modern environmental medicine.},

  abstract = {Background Privacy legislation in most jurisdictions allows the disclosure of health data for secondary purposes without patient consent if it is de-identified. Some recent articles in the medical, legal, and computer science literature have argued that de-identification methods do not provide sufficient protection because they are easy to reverse. Should this be the case, it would have significant and important implications on how health information is disclosed, including: (a) potentially limiting its availability for secondary purposes such as research, and (b) resulting in more identifiable health information being disclosed. Our objectives in this systematic review were to: (a) characterize known re-identification attacks on health data and contrast that to re-identification attacks on other kinds of data, (b) compute the overall proportion of records that have been correctly re-identified in these attacks, and (c) assess whether these demonstrate weaknesses in current de-identification methods. Methods and Findings Searches were conducted in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed. After screening, fourteen eligible articles representing distinct attacks were identified. On average, approximately a quarter of the records were re-identified across all studies (0.26 with 95\% CI 0.046–0.478) and 0.34 for attacks on health data (95\% CI 0–0.744). There was considerable uncertainty around the proportions as evidenced by the wide confidence intervals, and the mean proportion of records re-identified was sensitive to unpublished studies. Two of fourteen attacks were performed with data that was de-identified using existing standards. Only one of these attacks was on health data, which resulted in a success rate of 0.00013. Conclusions The current evidence shows a high re-identification rate but is dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards. This evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy of de-identification methods.},

This present work investigates the creation of a novel promising technique for producing an unleaded aviation gasoline 100UL through studying the influence of various aromatic amines, aromatic hydrocarbons, and MTBE on the antiknock characteristics of model blends of isooctane and n-heptane. Additionally, a nonlinear change in the antiknock performance of aromatic amines was established as the detonation resistance of the base fuel increased with the essential role of the structure of the aromatic amine. The results indicated that the optimal composition of the produced fuel was contained 57~wt\% of isooctane, 10~wt\% of isopentane, 10~wt\% of toluene, 5~wt\% of isopropylbenzene 15~wt\% of MTBE, 2~wt\% of m-toluidine, and 1~wt\% of isopropyl alcohol. What’s more, its characteristics were as close as possible to the properties of commercial aviation gasoline 100VLL and it did not contain other metal-containing additives. Finally, the concentrations of non-hydrocarbon additives, such as m-toluidine and MTBE were within the range that has been tested on an industrial scale during the operation of an automotive equipment in many countries of the world.},

Other studies have used hedonic regression with real estate prices and remotely sensed vegetation cover data in valuation models. However, remote sensing introduces unfamiliar perspectives since it changes the scale and resolution perceived by humans. Real estate prices also fluctuate and are not regularly used in urban decision-making processes. This study values an urban forest cultural ecosystem service by integrating an explanatory hedonic regression model with randomly field-measured tree, shrub, and turf data from four cities across Florida, USA, during 2006–2009, and congruent parcel tract-level home attributes and appraised property values from single and multi-family units for 2008–2009. Results, on average, indicate trade-offs in that more trees with greater Leaf Area Indices (LAIs) add to property value, while biomass and tree–shrub cover have a neutral effect, and replacing tree with grass cover has lower value. On average, property value increased by \$1586 per tree and \$9348 per one-unit increase in LAI, while increasing maintained grass from 25\% to 75\% decreased home value by \$271. Our ecological approach is an alternative, applied method that can be used by decision-makers for policy and cost–benefit analyses that calculate the stream of net benefits associated with urban forests.},

  abstract = {Formation of the biofilm matrix induces a unique environment for bacteria that allows the dynamic biofilm mode of life. Biofilms, and the resulting lifestyle, are built in specific, defined steps, producing a bacterial community that is heterogeneous in space and time.Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) immobilize biofilm cells, keeping them in long-term close proximity and, thus, allowing intense interactions to occur, including cell–cell communication, horizontal gene transfer and the formation of synergistic microconsortia.Owing to the retention of extracellular enzymes in the matrix, a versatile external digestive system is generated: dissolved and particulate nutrients imported through the water phase of the matrix can be sequestered, accumulated and utilized. The matrix acts as an ultimate recycling yard, keeping all the components of lysed cells available, including DNA, and possibly therefore serving as a large genetic archive. Gradient formation creates a wide range of very different habitats, contributing to biodiversity in biofilms.The matrix protects organisms in the biofilm from desiccation, biocides, antibiotics, heavy metals, ultraviolet radiation, host immune defences and many protozoan grazers.Eventually, EPS can serve as a nutrient source, but — as for many other structural polymers in biology — some EPS components are only slowly biodegradable. The vast variety of EPS components means that their complete degradation requires a wide range of enzymes.Ecologically, competition and cooperation in the confined space of the EPS matrix, and competition for the limited nutrients in particular, lead to constant adaptation of population fitness.},

  abstract = {In an increasingly urbanized world, air pollution mitigation is considered one of most important issues in city planning. Urban trees help to improve air quality by facilitating widespread deposition of various gases and particles through the provision of large surface areas as well as through their influence on microclimate and air turbulence. However, many of these trees produce wind-dispersed pollen (a known allergen) and emit a range of gaseous substances that take part in photochemical reactions – all of which can negatively affect air quality. The degree to which these air-quality impacts are manifested depends on species-specific tree properties: that is, their “traits”. We summarize and discuss the current knowledge on how such traits affect urban air pollution. We also present aggregated traits of some of the most common tree species in Europe, which can be used as a decision-support tool for city planning and for improving urban air-quality models.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to estimate and compare the air pollution exposures experienced by commuters in six common transportation modes utilized by California residents, and to evaluate the impact of practical exposure mitigation strategies in reducing commute exposures. We measured concentrations of fine particle matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particles (UFP) for 161 commutes between April 2014 and November 2015 in Sacramento, CA. We collected measurements for six modes including single occupancy vehicles, high occupancy vehicles (multiple occupants), buses, light rail, train, and bicycling. The largest average concentrations for most pollutants were measured during train commutes and the lowest average concentrations were observed during light-rail commutes. Mitigation options were explored for personal vehicles, bicycling, and train commute modes. We found that ventilation settings of personal vehicles can reduce in-vehicle PM2.5, BC, and UFP concentrations by up to 75\%. Similarly, bicycle route choice can reduce exposures by 15–75\% with the lowest concentrations observed during commutes on dedicated bicycle paths away from traffic sources. Train commuters experienced UFP concentrations an order of magnitude greater when the locomotive engine was pulling the rail cars versus pushing the rail cars. We found that UFP concentrations during bus, bicycling, and train commutes were 1.6–5.3 times greater than personal vehicle commutes, while light rail commutes had 30\% lower UFP concentrations than personal vehicle commutes. The largest exposure per mile occurred during bicycle commutes with PM2.5, BC, and UFP exposures of 1.312 μg/mile, 0.097 μg/mile, and 3.0~×~109 particles/mile, respectively. Train commutes experienced the largest exposure per mile of all of the combustion-derived transportation commute modes. BC accounted for 5–20\% of total PM mass across all commute modes with an average fraction of ∼7\% of PM2.5.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is known as a significant risk factor for mortality and morbidity due to cardiorespiratory causes. Owing to increased interest in assessing personal and community exposures to PM, we evaluated the feasibility of employing a low-cost portable direct-reading instrument for measurement of ambient air PM exposure. A Dylos DC 1700 PM sensor was collocated with a Grimm 11-R in an urban residential area of Houston Texas. The 1-min averages of particle number concentrations for sizes between 0.5 and 2.5 µm (small size) and sizes larger than 2.5 µm (large size) from a DC 1700 were compared with the 1-min averages of PM2.5 (aerodynamic size less than 2.5 µm) and coarse PM (aerodynamic size between 2.5 and 10 µm) concentrations from a Grimm 11-R. We used a linear regression equation to convert DC 1700 number concentrations to mass concentrations, utilizing measurements from the Grimm 11-R. The estimated average DC 1700 PM2.5 concentration (13.2 ± 13.7 µg/m3) was similar to the average measured Grimm 11-R PM2.5 concentration (11.3 ± 15.1 µg/m3). The overall correlation (r2) for PM2.5 between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R was 0.778. The estimated average coarse PM concentration from the DC 1700 (5.6 ± 12.1 µg/m3) was also similar to that measured with the Grimm 11-R (4.8 ± 16.5 µg/m3) with an r2 of 0.481. The effects of relative humidity and particle size on the association between the DC 1700 and the Grimm 11-R results were also examined. The calculated PM mass concentrations from the DC 1700 were close to those measured with the Grimm 11-R when relative humidity was less than 60\% for both PM2.5 and coarse PM. Particle size distribution was more important for the association of coarse PM between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R than it was for PM2.5. IMPLICATIONS: The performance of a low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensor was evaluated in an urban residential area. Both PM2.5 and coarse PM (PM10-2.5) mass concentrations were estimated using a DC1700 PM sensor. The calculated PM mass concentrations from the number concentrations of DC 1700 were close to those measured with the Grimm 11-R when relative humidity was less than 60\% for both PM2.5 and coarse PM. Particle size distribution was more important for the association of coarse PM between the DC 1700 and Grimm 11-R than it was for PM2.5.},

Standard acrylic PDTs significantly overestimated NO2 concentrations relative to chemiluminescence analysers, by an average of 27\% over all sites for 1-week exposures. No significant difference was observed between standard and foil-wrapped acrylic tubes (both UV blocking). The mean ratio between quartz (UV transmitting) tubes and chemiluminescence analysers was 1.06. Quartz PDT data suggest a tendency for in situ photolysis to offset (but in a non-quantifiable way) the effect of chemical overestimation. The 4-week exposures yielded systematically lower NO2 concentration than average NO2 from four sequential 1-week exposures over the same period. The reduction in the apparent NO2 sampling rate with time mostlikely arises from in situ photolysis of trapped NO2. Hourly NO2, NO and O3 data for 20 1-week exposures were used as input to a numerical model of diffusion tube operation incorporating chemical reaction between co-diffusing NO and O3 within the tube. The mean calculated overestimation of 22\% for NO2 from the PDT model simulations is close to the average difference between acrylic PDT and analyser NO2 concentrations (24\% for the same exposure periods), showing that within-tube chemistry can account for observed discrepancies in NO2 measurement between the two techniques. Overestimation by PDT generally increased as average NO2/NOx ratios decreased. Accurate quantitative correction of PDT measurements is not possible. Nevertheless, PDT NO2 concentrations were correlated with both analyser NO2 and NOx suggesting that acrylic PDTs retain a qualitative measure of NO2 and NOx variation at a particular urban location.},

The averageratios of passive sampler to analyser NO2 at acity centre site (mean NO2 concentration 22 ppb)are 1.27 (n = 22), 1.16 (n = 34) and 1.11 (n = 7) forexposures of 1, 2 and 4-weeks, respectively. Modellingthe generation of extra NO2 arising from chemicalreaction between co-diffusing NO and O3 in thetube gave a ratio (modelled/measured) of 1.31 for1-week exposures. Such overestimation is greatest whenNO2 constitutes, on average, about half of totalNOx (= NO + NO2) at the monitoring locality.Although 4-week exposures gave concentrations whichwere not significantly different from analyserNO2, there was no correlation between thedatasets. At both the city-centre site and anothersemi-rural site (mean NO2 concentration 11 ppb)the average of the aggregate of four consecutive1-week sampler exposures or of two consecutive 2-weeksampler exposures was systematically greater than fora single 4-week exposure.The results indicate two independent and opposingsystematic biases in measurement of NO2 bypassive diffusion sampler: an exposure-timeindependent chemical overestimation with magnitudedetermined by local relative concentrations of NO andO3 to NO2, and an exposure-time dependentreduction in sampling efficiency. The impact of theseand other potential sources of systematic bias on theapplication of passive diffusion tubes for assessingambient concentrations of NO2 in short (1-week)or long (4-week) exposures are discussed in detail.},

While the risks of air pollution to health were thought to have been brought under control by the Clean Air Acts of the 1950s and 1960s, the situation of air pollution in the UK has now deteriorated to a point where it is contributing to 40,000 excess deaths each year. Here the findings of the RCP/RCPCH’s 2015/16 Working Party on Air Pollution and Health are described and what actions now need to be taken. The UK needs to take a lead and introduce a new Clean Air Act that deals with the vehicle sources of pollution recognising that the toxic particles and gases emitted are effecting individuals from conception to death. This mandates urgent action by government both central and local, but also by all of us who have now become so dependent on road transport.},

The development and evaluation of more portable and affordable monitoring instruments based on low-cost sensors may offer a means to supplement and extend existing infrastructure, increasing the density and coverage of empirical measurements and thereby improving exposure science and control. Here, we report on field calibrations of a custom-built, battery-operated aerosol monitoring instrument we developed using low-cost, off-the-shelf optical aerosol sensors. We calibrated our instruments using 1 h and 24 h PM\textsubscript{2.5} data from a class III US EPA Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM\textsubscript{2.5} β-attenuation monitor in continuous operation at a regulatory monitoring site in Oakland, California. We observed negligible associations with ambient humidity and temperature; linear corrections were sufficient to explain 60\% of the variance in 1 h reference PM\textsubscript{2.5} data and 72\% of the variance in 24 h data. Performance at 1 h integration times was comparable to commercially available optical instruments costing considerably more. These findings warrant further exploration of the circumstances under which this class of aerosol sensors may profitably be deployed to generate improved PM\textsubscript{2.5} data sets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Understanding the relationship between ambient air pollution exposure and health outcomes informs actions to reduce exposure and disease risk.Objectives: To evaluate the association between ambient PM2.5 levels and healthcare encounters for acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI).Methods: Using an observational case-crossover design, subjects (n\,=\,146,397) were studied if they had an ALRI diagnosis and resided on Utah’s Wasatch Front. PM2.5 air pollution concentrations were measured using community-based air quality monitors between 1999 and 2016. Odds ratios for ALRI healthcare encounters were calculated after stratification by ages 0–2, 3–17, and 18 or more years.Measurements and Main Results: Approximately 77\% (n\,=\,112,467) of subjects were 0–2 years of age. The odds of ALRI encounter for these young children increased within 1 week of elevated PM2.5 and peaked after 3 weeks with a cumulative 28-day odds ratio of 1.15 per +10 μg/m3 (95\% confidence interval, 1.12–1.19). ALRI encounters with diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus and influenza increased following elevated ambient PM2.5 levels. Similar elevated odds for ALRI were also observed for older children, although the number of events and precision of estimates were much lower.Conclusions: In this large sample of urban/suburban patients, short-term exposure to elevated PM2.5 air pollution was associated with greater healthcare use for ALRI in young children, older children, and adults. Further exploration is needed of causal interactions between PM2.5 and ALRI.},

  abstract = {The metalloid arsenic is a natural environmental contaminant to which humans are routinely exposed in food, water, air, and soil. Arsenic has a long history of use as a homicidal agent, but in the past 100 years arsenic, has been used as a pesticide, a chemotherapeutic agent and a constituent of consumer products. In some areas of the world, high levels of arsenic are naturally present in drinking water and are a toxicological concern. There are several structural forms and oxidation states of arsenic because it forms alloys with metals and covalent bonds with hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and other elements. Environmentally relevant forms of arsenic are inorganic and organic existing in the trivalent or pentavalent state. Metabolism of arsenic, catalyzed by arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase, is a sequential process of reduction from pentavalency to trivalency followed by oxidative methylation back to pentavalency. Trivalent arsenic is generally more toxicologically potent than pentavalent arsenic. Acute effects of arsenic range from gastrointestinal distress to death. Depending on the dose, chronic arsenic exposure may affect several major organ systems. A major concern of ingested arsenic is cancer, primarily of skin, bladder, and lung. The mode of action of arsenic for its disease endpoints is currently under study. Two key areas are the interaction of trivalent arsenicals with sulfur in proteins and the ability of arsenic to generate oxidative stress. With advances in technology and the recent development of animal models for arsenic carcinogenicity, understanding of the toxicology of arsenic will continue to improve.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the privacy of online health data. We present a novel online health data De-Anonymization (DA) framework, named De-Health. De-Health consists of two phases: Top-K DA, which identifies a candidate set for each anonymized user, and refined DA, which de-anonymizes an anonymized user to a user in its candidate set. By employing both candidate selection and DA verification schemes, De-Health significantly reduces the DA space by several orders of magnitude while achieving promising DA accuracy. Leveraging two real world online health datasets WebMD (89,393 users, 506K posts) and HealthBoards (388,398 users, 4.7M posts), we validate the efficacy of De-Health. Further, when the training data are insufficient, De-Health can still successfully de-anonymize a large portion of anonymized users. We develop the first analytical framework on the soundness and effectiveness of online health data DA. By analyzing the impact of various data features on the anonymity, we derive the conditions and probabilities for successfully de-anonymizing one user or a group of users in exact DA and Top-K DA. Our analysis is meaningful to both researchers and policy makers in facilitating the development of more effective anonymization techniques and proper privacy polices. We present a linkage attack framework which can link online health/medical information to real world people. Through a proof-of-concept attack, we link 347 out of 2805 WebMD users to real world people, and find the full names, medical/health information, birthdates, phone numbers, and other sensitive information for most of the re-identified users. This clearly illustrates the fragility of the notion of privacy of those who use online health forums.},

  abstract = {Commuting is considered as one of the high-exposure periods among various daily activities, especially in high vehicle-density metropolitan areas. There is a growing awareness of the need to change our transportation habits by reducing our use of cars and shifting instead to active transport, i.e. walking or cycling. A review was undertaken using the ISI web of knowledge database with the objective to better understand personal exposure during commuting by different modes of transport, and to suggest potential strategies to minimise exposure. The air pollutants studied include particulate matter, PM black carbon, BC and particle number concentration. We focused only in European studies in order to have comparable situation in terms of vehicle fleet and policy regulations applied. Studies on personal exposure to air pollutants during car commuting are more numerous than those dealing with other types of transport, and typically conclude by emphasising that travelling by car involves exposure to relatively high particulate matter, PM exposure concentrations. Thus, compared to other transport methods, travelling by car has been shown to involve exposure both to higher PM and BC as compared with cycling. Widespread dependence on private car transport has produced a significant daily health threat to the urban commuter. However, a forward-looking, integrated transport policy, involving the phased renovation of existing public vehicles and the withdrawal of the more polluting private vehicles, combined with incentives to use public transport and the encouragement of commuter physical exercise, would reduce commuters' exposure.},

  abstract = {The promise of big data relies on the release and aggregation of data sets. When these data sets contain sensitive information about individuals, it has been scalable and convenient to protect the privacy of these individuals by de-identification. However, studies show that the combination of de-identified data sets with other data sets risks re-identification of some records. Some studies have shown how to measure this risk in specific contexts where certain types of public data sets (such as voter roles) are assumed to be available to attackers. To the extent that it can be accomplished, such analyses enable the threat of compromises to be balanced against the benefits of sharing data. For example, a study that might save lives by enabling medical research may be enabled in light of a sufficiently low probability of compromise from sharing de-identified data. In this paper, we introduce a general probabilistic re-identification framework that can be instantiated in specific contexts to estimate the probability of compromises based on explicit assumptions. We further propose a baseline of such assumptions that enable a first-cut estimate of risk for practical case studies. We refer to the framework with these assumptions as the Naive Re-identification Framework (NRF). As a case study, we show how we can apply NRF to analyze and quantify the risk of re-identification arising from releasing de-identified medical data in the context of publicly-available social media data. The results of this case study show that NRF can be used to obtain meaningful quantification of the re-identification risk, compare the risk of different social media, and assess risks of combinations of various demographic attributes and medical conditions that individuals may voluntarily disclose on social media.},

  abstract = {Agile development practices have become widely accepted as an effective project management approach in order to have rapid delivery of high-quality software. As with traditional waterfall projects, effective communication is also a necessity for the success of an agile project. However, the agile principles set a different tone for project development. The difference in tone is also reflected on how requirements are captured, analyzed and communicated under the agile umbrella. Little contemporary data exists that document actual practices of software professionals for software Requirements Engineering (RE) activities in agile environments. To remedy this deficiency and provide useful data to other researchers we conducted a survey study on the current RE state of practice. In this paper, we run a series of Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) tests to examine a set of null hypothesis on the performance of and satisfaction with various RE related activities in environments where RE are practiced and communicated in agile context in comparison to the classical waterfall context. The results indicated that there is no difference that can be determined between the agile and waterfall in regards with the satisfaction with the RE practices, but also a higher level of satisfaction for agile sample in comparison to waterfall) can be determined in regards to aspects related to productivity and final product quality.},

  abstract = {Many studies rely on air pollution modeling such as land use regression (LUR) or atmospheric dispersion (AD) modeling in epidemiological and health impact assessments. Generally, these models are only validated using one validation dataset and their estimates at select receptor points are generalized to larger areas. The primary objective of this paper was to explore the effect of different validation datasets on the validation of air quality models. The secondary objective was to explore the effect of the model estimates’ spatial resolution on the models’ validity at different locations. Annual NOx and NO2 were generated using a LUR and an AD model. These estimates were validated against four measurement datasets, once when estimates were made at the exact locations of the validation points and once when estimates were made at the centroid of the 100m×100m grid in which the validation point fell. The validation results varied substantially based on the model and validation dataset used. The LUR models’ R2 ranged between 21\% and 58\%, based on the validation dataset. The AD models’ R2 ranged between 13\% and 56\% based on the validation dataset and the use of constant or varying background NOx. The validation results based on model estimates at the exact validation site locations were much better than those based on a 100m×100m grid. This paper demonstrated the value of validating modeled air quality against various datasets and suggested that the spatial resolution of the models’ estimates has a significant influence on the validity at the application point.},

  abstract = {Microbial biofilm formation can be influenced by many physiological and genetic factors. The conventional microtiter plate assay provides useful but limited information about biofilm formation. With the fast expansion of the biofilm research field, there are urgent needs for more informative techniques to quantify the major parameters of a biofilm, such as adhesive strength and total biomass. It would be even more ideal if these measurements could be conducted in a real-time, non-invasive manner. In this study, we used quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and microjet impingement (MJI) to measure total biomass and adhesive strength, respectively, of S. mutans biofilms formed under different sucrose concentrations. In conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the COMSTAT software, we show that sucrose concentration affects the biofilm strength, total biomass, and architecture in both qualitative and quantitative manners. Our data correlate well with previous observations about the effect of sucrose on the adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface, and demonstrate that QCM is a useful tool for studying the kinetics of biofilm formation in real time and that MJI is a sensitive, easy-to-use device to measure the adhesive strength of a biofilm.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Dental caries has been closely linked to fermentable carbohydrates as key environmental factors. Sucrose has been identified as the most cariogenic carbohydrate. Streptococcus mutans, considered to be the primary pathogen causing dental caries, is able to utilize sucrose as a nutrient source, partially for the production of intracellular storage components and for the production of extracellular glucans via the glucosyltransferases GtfB, GtfC, and GtfD. The following study explores the competitiveness and fitness of S. mutans when grown with different concentrations of sucrose. Methods: Growth competition with oral streptococci and antimicrobial susceptibility in static biofilm models grown without sucrose or with 0.1\% or 0.5\% sucrose were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The numbers of surviving S. mutans of both wild-type and an isogenic Gtf-negative mutant after antimicrobial treatment were determined as colony-forming units. Results: S. mutans was able to establish microcolonies with increasing sucrose concentration in the presence of other streptococcal competitors during biofilm development. The antimicrobial susceptibility decreased when sucrose was available as substrate and was dependent on the presence of the Gtfs. Conclusion: The increased resistance against antimicrobial treatment was associated with the availability of sucrose, but was not influenced much by the concentration used during this study. The resistance was strongly associated with the Gtf activity, excluding any intracellular metabolic effect of sucrose in the resistance mechanism.},

  abstract = {Software and system development faces numerous challenges of rapidly changing markets. To address such challenges, companies and projects design and adopt specific development approaches by combining well-structured comprehensive methods and flexible agile practices. Yet, the number of methods and practices is large, and available studies argue that the actual process composition is carried out in a fairly ad-hoc manner. The present paper reports on a survey on hybrid software development approaches. We study which approaches are used in practice, how different approaches are combined, and what contextual factors influence the use and combination of hybrid software development approaches. Our results from 69 study participants show a variety of development approaches used and combined in practice. We show that most combinations follow a pattern in which a traditional process model serves as framework in which several fine-grained (agile) practices are plugged in. We further show that hybrid software development approaches are independent from the company size and external triggers. We conclude that such approaches are the results of a natural process evolution, which is mainly driven by experience, learning, and pragmatism.},

This research optimised the detonation efficiency of 14 aviation/motor fuels/blends. Type of fuels/blends and engine speed were chosen as input parameters. Relative detonation index was the output parameter. The engine speed was differed from 2000 to 2700 and the fuels were changed at fourteen levels. The design matrix consisted of 98 runs and was based on one factor response surface methodology. Analysis of variance was done on the design model to authenticate the significance. Engine speed and type of fuel were set to be in range while relative detonation index was minimised. Confirmation experiment was performed to check and confirm the actual and predicted outcomes. Results showed that at 2300 engine speed, Research Octane Number 98 fuel exhibited the best desirability of 0.759 among all fuels/blends with 57.153\% of relative detonation index. The outcome revealed that tetraethyl lead addition into the aviation gasoline low lead can be eliminated.},

Tetraethyl lead in aviation gasoline is the cause of severe health effects and is considered as human carcinogenic compound. Piston aviation fuels initiative evaluated 245 unleaded fuels, but none could match all the performance regulations of aviation gasoline. In this study, optimisation of the knock-limited performance of 83 leaded/unleaded/blends was carried out. The input parameters were the fuels and engine speed. The output parameters were knock-limited data of brake horsepower, torque, brake mean effective pressure, brake specific fuel consumption and average air-to-fuel ratio. The engine speed was varied at 2350–2700 and the fuels were varied at eighty-three levels. The design matrix was selected based on one factor of response surface methodology which contained 581 experimental runs. Analysis of variance was performed on the models to validate the robustness of the model tested. Engine speed, type of fuel and average air-to-fuel ratio were set to be in range while brake horsepower, torque and brake mean effective pressure were maximised and brake specific fuel consumption was minimised. Confirmation test was carried out to validate the predicted and actual outcomes. Results indicated that when the engine was run with a speed of 2700 RPM, RSM AVGAS 100LL MS gave optimum solution with corresponding brake horsepower, torque, brake mean effective pressure, brake specific fuel consumption and average air-to-fuel ratio values of 292.837~Hp, 777.557~Nm, 1099.521~kPa, 0.271~kg/kW~h and 13.044 respectively with a desirability of 0.972.

Alternatively, unleaded Motor Gasoline (MOGAS) is an alternative for AVGAS. In this study, all the test fuels were characterised based on chemical and physical properties of the fuels. GC analysis of the tested fuels were categorised based on hydrocarbon types and basic fuel properties. For optimisation, engine speed and fuel were the input parameters and Brake Horsepower (BHP), Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTHE), Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Unburned Hydrocarbon (HC) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) were the output responses. The engine speed (RPM) was varied at 2000–2700 and the fuels were RON 98 (unleaded high-aromatic MOGAS), AVGAS, 20\%, 30\%, 50\%, 70\% and 80\% blend ratios. One factor response surface methodology (RSM) which contained 49 experimental runs was used. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed on the models. Values of “Prob\,{$>$}\,F”, differences between “Predicted R2” and “adjusted R2” and ‘Adequate Precision” determined model validation. BHP and BTHE were maximised and BSFC and the emissions were minimised. Confirmation test was carried out to evaluate errors. Results indicated that at 2077 RPM, RON 98 fuel gave optimum solution of all tested fuels and the corresponding values of BHP, BTHE, BSFC, CO, HC and NOx were found to be 136 Hp, 31\%, 0.25\,Kg/kW-hr, 6.7\%, 350\,ppm and 51\,ppm respectively with a desirability index of 0.713.},

Researchers focused on mercury exposure because mercury concentrations were present in the stack emissions, and environmental monitoring revealed mercury concentrations near the plant. In 1984 and 1994 the median hair mercury concentrations were 0.5 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively. During the 10-y period, median hair total mercury concentrations increased by 0.35 mg/kg in workers (n = 11); by 0.16 mg/kg, 0.13 mg/kg, and 0.03 mg/kg in individuals who lived 2 km (n = 45), 2–4 km (n = 38), and 5 km (n = 30) from the plant, respectively; and by 0.02 mg/kg in the reference group (n = 55). In summary, mercury exposure increased as distance from the plant decreased; however, the increase in exposure was minimal and, on the basis of current knowledge, did not pose a health risk.},

  abstract = {Dental caries is a biofilm-dependent oral disease, and fermentable dietary carbohydrates are the key environmental factors involved in its initiation and development. However, among the carbohydrates, sucrose is considered the most cariogenic, because, in addition to being fermented by oral bacteria, it is a substrate for the synthesis of extracellular (EPS) and intracellular (IPS) polysaccharides. Therefore, while the low pH environment triggers the shift of the resident plaque microflora to a more cariogenic one, EPS promote changes in the composition of the biofilms’ matrix. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the biofilm formed in the presence of sucrose presents low concentrations of Ca, Pi, and F, which are critical ions involved in de- and remineralization of enamel and dentin in the oral environment. Thus, the aim of this review is to explore the broad role of sucrose in the cariogenicity of biofilms, and to present a new insight into its influence on the pathogenesis of dental caries.},

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were used as the sorbent material. Nanotubes were synthesized according to a well-known procedure and successfully used avoiding cumbersome purifications from traces of catalyst. A series of lab-scale experiments was performed on dispersions of commercial unleaded gasoline (20\,mL) in water (30\,mL), which were subjected to the action of variable amounts of MWCNTs at room temperature. Physicochemical characteristics and sorbent capacity of nanotubes were investigated by thermal analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The highest percentage of removed unleaded gasoline was obtained using small amounts (0.7\,g) of MWCNTs, over very short stirring times (5\,min). The composition of residual organic materials in water was investigated by 1H and 13C high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, which confirmed the almost complete removal of unleaded gasoline hydrocarbon components from polluted waters.},

  abstract = {While drinking water disinfection has effectively prevented waterborne diseases, an unintended consequence is the generation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Epidemiological studies have consistently observed an association between consumption of chlorinated drinking water with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Out of the {$>$}600 DBPs identified, regulations focus on a few classes, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), whose concentrations were hypothesized to correlate with the DBPs driving the toxicity of disinfected waters. However, the DBPs responsible for the bladder cancer association remain unclear. Utilities are switching away from a reliance on chlorination of pristine drinking water supplies to the application of new disinfectant combinations to waters impaired by wastewater effluents and algal blooms. In light of these changes in disinfection practice, this article discusses new approaches being taken by analytical chemists, engineers, toxicologists and epidemiologists to characterize the DBP classes driving disinfected water toxicity, and suggests that DBP exposure should be measured using other DBP classes in addition to THMs.},

Research design and methods We assessed the effects of long-term ambient air pollution exposures on diabetes mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a cohort of approximately a half million subjects across the contiguous U.S. The cohort, with a follow-up period between 1995 and 2011, was linked to residential census tract estimates for annual mean concentration levels of PM2.5, NO2, and O3. Associations between the air pollutants and the risk of diabetes mortality (N\,=\,3598) were evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for both individual-level and census-level contextual covariates. Results Diabetes mortality was significantly associated with increasing levels of both PM2.5 (HR = 1.19; 95\% CI: 1.03–1.39 per 10\,μg/m3) and NO2 (HR = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.01–1.18 per 10\,ppb). The strength of the relationship was robust to alternate exposure assessments and model specifications. We also observed significant effect modification, with elevated mortality risks observed among those with higher BMI and lower levels of fruit consumption. Conclusions We found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2, but not O3, is related to increased risk of diabetes mortality in the U.S, with attenuation of adverse effects by lower BMI and higher fruit consumption, suggesting that air pollution is involved in the etiology and/or control of diabetes.},

  abstract = {Objectives Studies of hunter–gatherer oral pathology, particularly in Australia, often focus upon dental wear and caries or assume that historic studies of Aboriginal people reflect the precontact past. Consequently the range of population variation has been underestimated. In this paper dental pathology from human remains from Roonka are compared with a model of dental pathology derived from historic studies. The aim is to identify aspects of dental pathology indicative of regional or intra-population diversity. Methods Adult dentitions (n = 115) dating from the mid to late Holocene were recorded for the following conditions: dental wear, caries, periapical voids, calculus, periodontal disease and antemortem tooth loss. Statistical analysis was used to identify patterns of dental pathology and to identify causal relationships between conditions. Results Dental wear is marked while dental caries rates are extremely low. Other indications of dental pathology are uncommon ({$<$}7\% of teeth affected). Temporal heterogeneity is apparent: there are 3 young adults with caries who died in the postcontact period. There is also a small group of middle age to old adults with disproportionate abscessing and pulp exposure who may represent temporal variation or heterogeneity in individual frailty. Conclusions The results confirm dental wear as the major cause of dental pathology in this group and that, at a general level, historic accounts do correspond with this archeological sample. However, intra-sample heterogeneity is apparent while 2 dental conditions, calculus and periodontal disease, along with the pattern of sex differences deviate from expectation, demonstrating that to identify regional variation attention needs to be paid to the dentoalveolar complex as a whole.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Short-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with asthma exacerbation and increased health-care use due to asthma, but its effect on asthma mortality remains largely unknown. Objectives: To quantitatively assess the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and asthma mortality. Methods: We investigated 4,454 individuals who lived in Hubei province, China and died from asthma between 2013 and 2018. A case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were applied for data analyses. Exposures to particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) were estimated by inverse distance weighted averages of all monitoring stations within 50 km from each case’s home address. Measurements and Main Results: Each interquartile range (IQR) increase of PM2.5 (lag 3; IQR: 47.1 µg/m3), NO2 (lag 03; IQR: 26.3 µg/m3) and O3 (lag 3; IQR: 52.9 µg/m3) were positively associated with asthma mortality, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.12), 1.11 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.22) and 1.09 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.18), respectively. There was no evidence of departure from linearity for these associations. Further adjustment for other pollutants did not change the associations materially. We did not observe significant associations between PM10, SO2, CO exposures and asthma mortality. Overall, the estimates remained consistent in various sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our results provide new evidence that short-term exposures to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 may increase asthma mortality risk. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in other populations.},

  abstract = {We have an addiction to fossil fuels, and it’s not sustainable. The developed  world gets 80\% of its energy from fossil fuels; Britain, 90\%. And  this is unsustainable for three reasons. First, easily-accessible fossil fuels  will at some point run out, so we’ll eventually have to get our energy  from someplace else. Second, burning fossil fuels is having a measurable  and very-probably dangerous effect on the climate. Avoiding dangerous  climate change motivates an immediate change from our current use of  fossil fuels. Third, even if we don’t care about climate change, a drastic  reduction in Britain’s fossil fuel consumption would seem a wise move if  we care about security of supply: continued rapid use of the North Sea Photo by Terry Cavner.  oil and gas reserves will otherwise soon force fossil-addicted Britain to depend  on imports from untrustworthy foreigners. (I hope you can hear my  tongue in my cheek.)  How can we get off our fossil fuel addiction?  There’s no shortage of advice on how to “make a difference,” but the  public is confused, uncertain whether these schemes are fixes or figleaves.  People are rightly suspicious when companies tell us that buying their  “green” product means we’ve “done our bit.” They are equally uneasy  about national energy strategy. Are “decentralization” and “combined  heat and power,” green enough, for example? The government would have  us think so. But would these technologies really discharge Britain’s duties  regarding climate change? Are windfarms “merely a gesture to prove our  leaders’ environmental credentials”? Is nuclear power essential?  We need a plan that adds up. The good news is that such plans can be  made. The bad news is that implementing them will not be easy.},

  abstract = {Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is associated with negative human health effects, both for short-term peak concentrations and from long-term exposure to a wider range of NO2 concentrations. For the latter, the European Union has established an air quality limit value of 40\,µg\,m−3 as an annual average. However, factors such as proximity and strength of local emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorological conditions mean that there is substantial variation in the hourly NO2 concentrations contributing to an annual average concentration. The aim of this analysis was to quantify the nature of this variation at thousands of monitoring sites across Europe through the calculation of a standard set of chemical climatology statistics. Specifically, at each monitoring site that satisfied data capture criteria for inclusion in this analysis, annual NO2 concentrations, as well as the percentage contribution from each month, hour of the day, and hourly NO2 concentrations divided into 5\,µg\,m−3 bins were calculated. Across Europe, 2010–2014 average annual NO2 concentrations (NO2AA) exceeded the annual NO2 limit value at 8\,\% of {$>$}\,2500 monitoring sites. The application of this chemical climatology approach showed that sites with distinct monthly, hour of day, and hourly NO2 concentration bin contributions to NO2AA were not grouped into specific regions of Europe, furthermore, within relatively small geographic regions there were sites with similar NO2AA, but with differences in these contributions. Specifically, at sites with highest NO2AA, there were generally similar contributions from across the year, but there were also differences in the contribution of peak vs. moderate hourly NO2 concentrations to NO2AA, and from different hours across the day. Trends between 2000 and 2014 for 259 sites indicate that, in general, the contribution to NO2AA from winter months has increased, as has the contribution from the rush-hour periods of the day, while the contribution from peak hourly NO2 concentrations has decreased. The variety of monthly, hour of day and hourly NO2 concentration bin contributions to NO2AA, across cities, countries and regions of Europe indicate that within relatively small geographic areas different interactions between emissions, atmospheric chemistry and meteorology produce variation in NO2AA and the conditions that produce it. Therefore, measures implemented to reduce NO2AA in one location may not be as effective in others. The development of strategies to reduce NO2AA for an area should therefore consider (i) the variation in monthly, hour of day, and hourly NO2 concentration bin contributions to NO2AA within that area; and (ii) how specific mitigation actions will affect variability in hourly NO2 concentrations.},

The aim of the research is specifically to make contributions in the direction of the present scientific studies of UL aviation gasoline initiatives in piston aircrafts, globally specifically aiming on the vapor locking tendencies of aviation fuels, motor fuels and the blends and comparing the results both experimentally and statistically. Chemical and physical properties of the fuels were tested and categorised based on hydrocarbon types and properties. Study considered nine variables for vapor lock. Twenty-three aviation fuels from various literatures were collected, model equations derived, and respective comprehensive factor scores were calculated. The model was applied to the 14 fuels in this study and their respective comprehensive factor scores were calculated and ranked from the best to worst. The temperature of the gasoline as it approaches the carburettor was experimentally derived for comparative analysis with the comprehensive factor scores. Results showed that Kaiser’s Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) measure of sampling adequacy value is 0.728. Four common factors and their cumulative variance proportion of rotation sums of squared loadings has reached 95.530\%. Based on the loadings of the rotated components, PC1 has strong significant correlation with VL index of value 0.917. Among the aviation rated fuels, for vapor lock tendency UL 82, UL 87, SWIFT UL 102, SWIFT Binary Blend and 100 SF have the highest factor score. Fuels AVGAS 100LL (D910), AVF1, AVF2, AVF4, AVGAS, Leaded 91/98, and UL 94 exhibited very poor vapor lock tendencies. RON 98 exhibited the best VL protection among all the tested fuels in this study with ccomprehensive factor scores of 0.126166 and the best experimental temperature of the gasoline as it approaches the carburettor was also exhibited by RON 98. The findings showed that RON 98 able to outperform the commercial AVGAS in terms of vapor locking characteristics.},

  abstract = {Dental diseases are among the most prevalent and costly diseases affecting industrialized societies, and yet are highly preventable. The microflora of dental plaque biofilms from diseased sites is distinct from that found in health, although the putative pathogens can often be detected in low numbers at normal sites. In dental caries, there is a shift towards community dominance by acidogenic and acid-tolerant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli) at the expense of the acid-sensitive species associated with sound enamel. In contrast, the numbers and proportions of obligately anaerobic bacteria, including Gram-negative proteolytic species, increase in periodontal diseases. Modelling studies using defined consortia of oral bacteria grown in planktonic and biofilm systems have been undertaken to identify environmental factors responsible for driving these deleterious shifts in the plaque microflora. Repeated conditions of low pH (rather than sugar availability per se) selected for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, while the introduction of novel host proteins and glycoproteins (as occurs during the inflammatory response to plaque), and the concomitant rise in local pH, enriched for Gram-negative anaerobic and asaccharolytic species. These studies emphasized (a) significant properties of dental plaque as both a biofilm and a microbial community, and (b) the dynamic relationship existing between the environment and the composition of the oral microflora. This research resulted in a novel hypothesis (the ‘ecological plaque hypothesis’) to better describe the relationship between plaque bacteria and the host in health and disease. Implicit in this hypothesis is the concept that disease can be prevented not only by directly inhibiting the putative pathogens, but also by interfering with the environmental factors driving the selection and enrichment of these bacteria. Thus, a more holistic approach can be taken in disease control and management strategies.,},

  abstract = {This concept paper discusses the potential impact of chlorinated public drinking water on the assembly of the intestinal microbiome in infancy. The addition of chlorine or hypochlorite to metropolitan drinking water is routinely used worldwide as a sanitizer because of its potent anti-microbial properties. It is one of the most effective means of delivering safe drinkable water because it produces a residual disinfectant that persists within the distribution system. Levels of chlorine used to treat metropolitan water are considered safe for the individual, based on toxicity studies. However, to our knowledge there have been no studies examining whether levels of persistent chlorine exposure from tap water are also safe for the ecosystem of microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Given the importance of the microbiome in health, persistent exposure to low levels of chlorine may be a hitherto unrecognized risk factor for gut dysbiosis, which has now been linked to virtually every chronic non-communicable disease of the modern era. Although effects may be subtle, young children and infants are more susceptible to ecological disturbance, given that the microbiome is highly influenced by environmental factors during this period. Here I outline considerations for the safety of water disinfectants not just in terms of toxicity to the host, but also for the ecosystem of microorganisms that inhabit us. Research in this is likely to bear fruitful information that could either bring attention to this issue, potentially driving new innovations in public water management; or could help confirm the safety profile of chlorine levels in public drinking water.},

  abstract = {The U.S. EPA has tightened control of fine particles primarily by limiting maximum 24 h average airborne concentrations. The present investigation used real-time monitoring to record short-term PM excursions and literature evaluation to determine whether PM levels reached in excursions might be health significant. Data recorded in Birmingham, AL, Penticton, British Columbia, and Zeebrugge, Belgium revealed numerous excursions, one reaching 2,000 mu g/M3. Toxicology and clinical studies involving brief exposures to particle levels in the range of observed excursions elicited adverse effects in both animals and humans. The area of lung surface developing lesions was elevated in rats breathing the same 4 h dose of aerosols when the 4 h average rate of aerosol delivery included a short-term (greater than or equal to 5 min) burst (greater than or equal to 50\%) above the average dose rate. Elevations were observed with each of two aerosols tested. The magnitude of the effect was higher with one of the two aerosols, whose dose rate included four excursions rather than just one excursion. Symptom severity in asthmatics was associated with PM elevations, but the strength of the association depended upon the PM averaging time: the strength of the PM association with symptom severity increased as the PM averaging time varied from 24 h to 8 h to 1 h. Three hundred people were overcome after wind lofted particles into the air during a 4 day outdoor music festival in Queen Creek, AZ in April 1997. More research is necessary, but evidence presented here suggests that greater risk reduction might be achievable via controlling 1 h and 24 h PM averages than via tightening control of 24 h averages without controlling the 1 h average.},

  abstract = {The development of engineered nanomaterials is growing exponentially, despite concerns over their potential similarities to environmental nanoparticles that are associated with significant cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms through which inhalation of nanoparticles could trigger acute cardiovascular events are emerging, but a fundamental unanswered question remains: Do inhaled nanoparticles translocate from the lung in man and directly contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease? In complementary clinical and experimental studies, we used gold nanoparticles to evaluate particle translocation, permitting detection by high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry and Raman microscopy. Healthy volunteers were exposed to nanoparticles by acute inhalation, followed by repeated sampling of blood and urine. Gold was detected in the blood and urine within 15 min to 24 h after exposure, and was still present 3 months after exposure. Levels were greater following inhalation of 5 nm (primary diameter) particles compared to 30 nm particles. Studies in mice demonstrated the accumulation in the blood and liver following pulmonary exposure to a broader size range of gold nanoparticles (2-200 nm primary diameter), with translocation markedly greater for particles {$<$}10 nm diameter. Gold nanoparticles preferentially accumulated in inflammation-rich vascular lesions of fat-fed apolipoproteinE-deficient mice. Furthermore, following inhalation, gold particles could be detected in surgical specimens of carotid artery disease from patients at risk of stroke. Translocation of inhaled nanoparticles into the systemic circulation and accumulation at sites of vascular inflammation provides a direct mechanism that can explain the link between environmental nanoparticles and cardiovascular disease and has major implications for risk management in the use of engineered nanomaterials.},

  abstract = {Leaded fuel emissions exposed a global population of children to lead and its profound health consequences. Recognition of its harms precipitated a global phase out and replacement with unleaded substitutes for road vehicles. Despite this widespread recognition and action, aviation fuel for piston engine aircraft still contains lead. Leaded aviation fuel (AVGAS100LL) contains 0.56 g of tetraethyl lead (℡) per litre and this lead must be jettisoned from the engine during operation to prevent fouling. This action distributes lead and lead compounds into the air and soil around general aviation airports. This has been shown to increase the blood lead levels (BLLs) of children living nearby to clinically significant levels. Whilst this problem is recognised by the EPA in the United States, it has received little attention in the United Kingdom. We provide a review of the situation in the United Kingdom with regard to the current policy and regulation framework. We analysed the UK's general aviation airport fleet, general avation airport data and GB residential address data. We estimate the unleaded-readiness of the UK aviation fleet and the current usage of fuels at UK general aviation airports. We provide a first-order estimate of the number of residential addresses exposed to lead near general aviation airports. We find that the majority of aviation fuel sold in the United Kingdom is leaded and that there are 370,632 residences within 4 km of a general aviation airport at risk from exposure to lead emissions. Finally, we present a path forward for regulation change and public health monitoring.},

  abstract = {Background Short-term exposure to NO2 has been associated with adverse health effects and there is increasing concern that NO2 is causally related to health effects, not merely a marker of traffic-generated pollution. No comprehensive meta-analysis of the time-series evidence on NO2 has been published since 2007. Objective To quantitatively assess the evidence from epidemiological time-series studies published worldwide to determine whether and to what extent short-term exposure to NO2 is associated with increased numbers of daily deaths and hospital admissions. Design We conducted a quantitative systematic review of 204 time-series studies of NO2 and daily mortality and hospital admissions for several diagnoses and ages, which were indexed in three bibliographic databases up to May 2011. We calculated random-effects estimates by different geographic regions and globally, and also tested for heterogeneity and small study bias. Results Sufficient estimates for meta-analysis were available for 43 cause-specific and age-specific combinations of mortality or hospital admissions (25 for 24 h NO2 and 18 of the same combinations for 1 h measures). For the all-age group, a 10 µg/m3 increase in 24 h NO2 was associated with increases in all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (0.71\% (95\% CI 0.43\% to 1.00\%), 0.88\% (0.63\% to 1.13\%) and 1.09\% (0.75\% to 1.42\%), respectively), and with hospital admissions for respiratory (0.57\% (0.33\% to 0.82\%)) and cardiovascular (0.66\% (0.32\% to 1.01\%)) diseases. Evidence of heterogeneity between geographical region-specific estimates was identified in more than half of the combinations analysed. Conclusions Our review provides clear evidence of health effects associated with short-term exposure to NO2 although further work is required to understand reasons for the regional heterogeneity observed. The growing literature, incorporating large multicentre studies and new evidence from less well-studied regions of the world, supports further quantitative review to assess the independence of NO2 health effects from other air pollutants.},

  abstract = {Background: Aviation gasoline, commonly referred to as avgas, is a leaded fuel used in small aircraft. Recent concern about the effects of lead emissions from planes has motivated the U.S. Environmental Protection to consider regulating leaded avgas.Objective: In this study we investigated the relationship between lead from avgas and blood lead levels in children living in six counties in North Carolina.Methods: We used geographic information systems to approximate areas surrounding airports in which lead from avgas may be present in elevated concentrations in air and may also be deposited to soil. We then used regression analysis to examine the relationship between residential proximity to airports and North Carolina blood lead surveillance data in children 9 months to 7 years of age while controlling for factors including age of housing, socioeconomic characteristics, and seasonality.Results: Our results suggest that children living within 500 m of an airport at which planes use leaded avgas have higher blood lead levels than other children. This apparent effect of avgas on blood lead levels was evident also among children living within 1,000 m of airports. The estimated effect on blood lead levels exhibited a monotonically decreasing dose–response pattern, with the largest impact on children living within 500 m.Conclusions: We estimated a significant association between potential exposure to lead emissions from avgas and blood lead levels in children. Although the estimated increase was not especially large, the results of this study are nonetheless directly relevant to the policy debate surrounding the regulation of leaded avgas.},

Malnutrition (undernutrition or overnutrition) in children is often a consequence of inappropriate infant and childhood feeding practices and dietary behaviors associated with limited access to fresh, nutrient dense foods, substituting instead high-energy, low-cost, nutrient-poor sugary and fatty foods. Lack of availability of quality food stores in rural and poor neighborhoods, food insecurity, and changing dietary beliefs resulting from acculturation, including changes in traditional ethnic eating behaviors, can further deter healthful eating and increase risk for early childhood caries and obesity. America is witnessing substantial increases in children and ethnic minorities living in poverty, widening the gap in oral health disparities noted in Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General. Dental and other care providers can educate and counsel pregnant women, parents, and families to promote healthy eating behaviors and should advocate for governmental policies and programs that decrease parental financial and educational barriers to achieving healthy diets. For families living in poverty, however, greater efforts are needed to facilitate access to affordable healthy foods, particularly in urban and rural neighborhoods, to effect positive changes in children's diets and advance the oral components of general health.},

Given the increasing availability of writing samples online, our result has serious implications for anonymity and free speech - an anonymous blogger or whistleblower may be unmasked unless they take steps to obfuscate their writing style. While there is a huge body of literature on authorship recognition based on writing style, almost none of it has studied corpora of more than a few hundred authors. The problem becomes qualitatively different at a large scale, as we show, and techniques from prior work fail to scale, both in terms of accuracy and performance. We study a variety of classifiers, both "lazy" and "eager," and show how to handle the huge number of classes. We also develop novel techniques for confidence estimation of classifier outputs. Finally, we demonstrate stylometric authorship recognition on texts written in different contexts. In over 20\% of cases, our classifiers can correctly identify an anonymous author given a corpus of texts from 100,000 authors; in about 35\% of cases the correct author is one of the top 20 guesses. If we allow the classifier the option of not making a guess, via confidence estimation we are able to increase the precision of the top guess from 20\% to over 80\% with only a halving of recall.},

  abstract = {Background Unleaded petrol contains significant amounts of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX). Toxic responses following occupational exposure to unleaded petrol have been evaluated only in limited studies. The main purpose of this study was to ascertain whether (or not) exposure to unleaded petrol, under normal working conditions, is associated with any hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic response. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which 200 employees of Shiraz petrol stations with current exposure to unleaded petrol, as well as 200 unexposed employees, were investigated. Atmospheric concentrations of BTX were measured using standard methods. Additionally, urine and fasting blood samples were taken from individuals for urinalysis and routine biochemical tests of kidney and liver function. Results The geometric means of airborne concentrations of BTX were found to be 0.8~mg~m−3, 1.4~mg~m−3, and 2.8~mg~m−3, respectively. Additionally, means of direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea and plasma creatinine were significantly higher in exposed individuals than in unexposed employees. Conversely, serum albumin, total protein, and serum concentrations of calcium and sodium were significantly lower in petrol station workers than in their unexposed counterparts. Conclusion The average exposure of petrol station workers to BTX did not exceed the current threshold limit values (TLVs) for these chemicals. However, evidence of subtle, subclinical and prepathologic early liver and kidney dysfunction was evident in exposed individuals.},

Model predictions were compared with continuous, yearlong measurements from two near-roadway sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Heavy-duty diesel trucks were a significant source of NOx and BC at both sites. Characterization of temporal variations in heavy-duty truck activity on diurnal, weekly, and seasonal scales were included in this study; truck traffic and emissions are not well-correlated with passenger vehicle or total traffic volumes. For both pollutants, more than 90\% of predicted 24-h average concentrations were within a factor of two of observations at both near-roadway monitoring sites. The model responds appropriately to seasonal variations in meteorology and day-of-week variations in emissions. RLINE model performance for NOx was better overall than for BC. Reducing uncertainties in emission factors would help to improve model performance for BC.},

  abstract = {Purpose The South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) Case Register and its Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) application were developed in 2008, generating a research repository of real-time, anonymised, structured and open-text data derived from the electronic health record system used by SLaM, a large mental healthcare provider in southeast London. In this paper, we update this register's descriptive data, and describe the substantial expansion and extension of the data resource since its original development. Participants Descriptive data were generated from the SLaM BRC Case Register on 31 December 2014. Currently, there are over 250 000 patient records accessed through CRIS. Findings to date Since 2008, the most significant developments in the SLaM BRC Case Register have been the introduction of natural language processing to extract structured data from open-text fields, linkages to external sources of data, and the addition of a parallel relational database (Structured Query Language) output. Natural language processing applications to date have brought in new and hitherto inaccessible data on cognitive function, education, social care receipt, smoking, diagnostic statements and pharmacotherapy. In addition, through external data linkages, large volumes of supplementary information have been accessed on mortality, hospital attendances and cancer registrations. Future plans Coupled with robust data security and governance structures, electronic health records provide potentially transformative information on mental disorders and outcomes in routine clinical care. The SLaM BRC Case Register continues to grow as a database, with approximately 20 000 new cases added each year, in addition to extension of follow-up for existing cases. Data linkages and natural language processing present important opportunities to enhance this type of research resource further, achieving both volume and depth of data. However, research projects still need to be carefully tailored, so that they take into account the nature and quality of the source information.},

  abstract = {Streptococcus mutans is a member of oral plaque biofilms and is considered the major etiological agent of dental caries. We have characterized the survival of S. mutans strain UA159 in both batch cultures and biofilms. Bacteria grown in batch cultures in a chemically defined medium, FMC, containing an excess of glucose or sucrose caused the pH to decrease to 4.0 at the entry into stationary phase, and they survived for about 3 days. Survival was extended up to 11 days when the medium contained a limiting concentration of glucose or sucrose that was depleted by the time the bacteria reached stationary phase. Sugar-limited cultures maintained a pH of 7.0 throughout stationary phase. Their survival was shortened to 3 days by the addition of exogenous lactic acid at the entry into stationary phase. Sugar starvation did not lead to comparable survival in biofilms. Although the pH remained at 7.0, bacteria could no longer be cultured from biofilms 4 days after the imposition of glucose or sucrose starvation; BacLight staining results did not agree with survival results based on culturability. In both batch cultures and biofilms, survival could be extended by the addition of 0.5\% mucin to the medium. Batch survival increased to an average of 26 (±8) days, and an average of 2.7 × 105 CFU per chamber were still present in biofilms that were starved of sucrose for 12 days.},

  abstract = {The fate and transport of the soil fumigant, 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB) was studied at a former tobacco field in Simsbury, Connecticut where it was last used in 1967. The subsurface consists of glacial deposits of stratified sand, gravel, and silt underlain by a fractured sandstone/siltstone bedrock. Contaminant plumes in the bedrock had migrated only slightly from beneath the tobacco field after nearly two decades, consistent with calculated flow velocities. Contaminant levels in the overburden aquifer were much lower, which was consistent with higher calculated flow velocities resulting in off-site discharge to a nearby stream, and possibly with faster biodegradation. EDB concentrations in both zones were stable over the study period (1.5–2yr). Earlier demonstration of relatively fast biodegradation of 14C-EDB in aquifer core samples were contradicted by the plume stabilities observed here. EDB was found in vadose cores, particularly topsoils, at concentrations up to 32μg kg−1. These residues could not be extracted with water, even after 20 d, and were unavailable for biodegradation. By contrast added 14C-EDBwas mineralized almost completely in 22 d. EDB was also found in overburden aquifer cores, in some cases at concentrations much greater than predicted from equilibrium partition experiments. The results show that kinetically slow, nonequilibrium sorption is a factor in the decades-long persistence of this chemical in the topsoil and possibly in the aquifer.},

A total of 86 Palmes tubes were exposed at various conditions: wind velocities ranging from 0.15 to 2.3ms−1, temperatures from 2°C to 40°C and relative humidities from 20\% to 85\%. The main information is the high increase of sampling rate with increasing wind velocity. The formation of eddies at the open end of tube induces a reduction in the effective length of diffusion. This reduction starts up from the weak velocities of wind (i.e. 0.3m/s) and is estimated at 47\% for 2ms−1. Influences of temperature and relative humidity give the weak deviations, exceeding 10\% only under unusual conditions (T{$>$}30°C and RH{$>$}80\%). Under common conditions, the sampling rate regularly increases to 0.3\%/°C with temperature. Some practical solutions are proposed in this study to improve the accuracy of measurements. The use of a protective device and application of a corrective function appears through these results as effective means to correct the effects of meteorological factors on the sampling rate of tube.},

  abstract = {The sharing of sensitive personal health data is an important aspect of biomedical research. Methods of data de-identification are often used in this process to trade the granularity of data off against privacy risks. However, traditional approaches, such as HIPAA safe harbor or k-anonymization, often fail to provide data with sufficient quality. Alternatively, data can be de-identified only to a degree which still allows us to use it as required, e.g., to carry out specific analyses. Controlled environments, which restrict the ways recipients can interact with the data, can then be used to cope with residual risks. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, we present a method for implementing controlled data sharing environments and analyze its privacy properties. Second, we present a de-identification method which is specifically suited for sanitizing health data which is to be shared in such environments. Traditional de-identification methods control the uniqueness of records in a dataset. The basic idea of our approach is to reduce the probability that a record in a dataset has characteristics which are unique within the underlying population. As the characteristics of the population are typically not known, we have implemented a pragmatic solution in which properties of the population are modeled with statistical methods. We have further developed an accompanying process for evaluating and validating the degree of protection provided. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation show that our approach enables the safe sharing of high-quality data and that it is highly scalable.},

To test this hypothesis, teams of two cyclists and two car drivers in two cars were equipped with personal air samplers while driving for 4 h on 2 different days in the morning traffic of Copenhagen. The air sample charcoal tubes were analysed for their benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) content and the air filters for particles (total dust). The concentrations of particles and BTEX in the cabin of the cars were 2–4 times greater than in the cyclists’ breathing zone, the greatest difference being for BTEX. Therefore, even after taking the increased respiration rate of cyclists into consideration, car drivers seem to be more exposed to airborne pollution than cyclists.},

  abstract = {Background Chronic exposures to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter~{$<$} 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ozone pollution can affect respiratory function. ARDS, an often lethal respiratory failure, is most common among older adults. However, few epidemiology studies have investigated an association between air pollution and the risk of ARDS. Methods This observational study was conducted to estimate air pollution exposures at the~ZIP code level and hospital admissions with ARDS among US Medicare beneficiaries aged~≥ 65 years from 2000 to 2012. A two-pollutant generalized linear mixed model, adjusting for sex, age, race, median household income, smoking, and weather, was applied. Results There were a total of 1,164,784 hospital admissions with ARDS in the cohort. Increases of 1 μgm3 in annual average PM2.5 and of 1 parts per billion in annual average ozone were associated with increases in annual hospital admission rates for ARDS of 0.72\%~(95\%~CI, 0.62-0.82) and 0.15\%~(95\%~CI, 0.08-0.22), respectively. In low-pollution regions (annual average PM2.5 level~{$<$} 12 μgm3 and annual average ozone level~{$<$} 45 parts per billion), the same annual increase in PM2.5 and ozone were associated with increases in annual hospital admission rates for ARDS of 1.50\%~(95\%~CI, 1.27-1.72) and 0.27\%~(95\%~CI, 0.16-0.38). Conclusions Long-term exposures to PM2.5 and ozone were associated with increased risk of ARDS among older adults in the United States, including exposures below current annual US National Ambient Air Quality Standards.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children incur lead toxicity even at low blood-lead concentrations (BLCs), and testing in England is opportunistic. We described epidemiology of cases notified to a passive laboratory-based surveillance system (SS), the Lead Poisoning in Children (LPIC) SS to inform opportunities to prevent lead exposure in children in England. METHODS: Surveillance population: children {$<$}16 years of age and resident in England during the reporting period September 2014-17. Case definition: children with BLC ≥0.48 μmol/l (10 μg/dl). We extracted case demographic/location data and linked it with laboratory, area-level population and socio-economic status (SES) data. We described case BLCs and calculated age-, gender- and SES-specific notification rates, and age-sex standardised regional notification rates. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2017 there were 86 newly notified cases, giving an annual average notification rate of 2.76 per million children aged 0-15 years. Regionally, rates varied from 0.36 to 9.89 per million. Rates were highest in the most deprived quintile (5.38 per million), males (3.75 per million) and children aged 1-4 years (5.89 per million). CONCLUSIONS: Males, children aged 1-4 years, and children in deprived areas may be at higher risk, and could be targeted for primary prevention. Varied regional notification rates suggest differences in clinician awareness of lead exposure and risk factors; guidelines standardising the indications for BLC-testing may assist secondary prevention.},

  abstract = {The role of each of the Streptococcus mutans gtf genes coding for glucan synthesis in cariogenesis was evaluated by using strain UA130 in the specific-pathogen-free (SPF) rat model system. Mutants defective in either or both of the genes required for insoluble glucan synthesis, the gtfB and gtfC genes, exhibited markedly reduced levels of smooth-surface carious lesions relative to that of the parental organism. Likewise, the mutant defective in the gtfD gene coding for the glucosyltransferase-S enzyme synthesizing water-soluble glucans also produced significantly fewer smooth-surface lesions than strain UA130. None of these mutations markedly altered the rate of sulcal caries induction relative to that of the parental organism. In addition, a mutant of strain UA130 defective in the gtfA gene was reexamined in the SPF rat model. In contrast to previous results from a gnotobiotic rat system, these mutants also induced significantly fewer smooth-surface carious lesions compared with that by strain UA130. These results suggest that all four genes are important for smooth-surface caries formation. Furthermore, these results are discussed relative to the differences in the diets utilized in the SPF and gnotobiotic rat model systems for assessing the virulence factors of S. mutans.},

We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Örebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning.},

  abstract = {The importance of sugars as a cause of caries is underemphasized and not prominent in preventive strategies. This is despite overwhelming evidence of its unique role in causing a worldwide caries epidemic. Why this neglect? One reason is that researchers mistakenly consider caries to be a multifactorial disease; they also concentrate mainly on mitigating factors, particularly fluoride. However, this is to misunderstand that the only cause of caries is dietary sugars. These provide a substrate for cariogenic oral bacteria to flourish and to generate enamel-demineralizing acids. Modifying factors such as fluoride and dental hygiene would not be needed if we tackled the single cause—sugars. In this article, we demonstrate the sensitivity of cariogenesis to even very low sugars intakes. Quantitative analyses show a log-linear dose-response relationship between the sucrose or its monosaccharide intakes and the progressive lifelong development of caries. This results in a substantial dental health burden throughout life. Processed starches have cariogenic potential when accompanying sucrose, but human studies do not provide unequivocal data of their cariogenicity. The long-standing failure to identify the need for drastic national reductions in sugars intakes reflects scientific confusion partly induced by pressure from major industrial sugar interests.},

Such population is forced to undergo continuous stress imposed by combined exposure of the heavy metals and different classes of the pesticides used in agricultural as well as health practices. The existing reports from several workers have indicated that heavy metals and pesticides in combination may lead more severe impact on the human health when compared to their individual effects. Such a combination of pesticides and heavy metals may also change or influence the detection of exposure. Several studies in past have shown the synergistic toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides. Such evaluations have revealed the synergistic interactions of various heavy metals and pesticides in animals as well as humans. The aim of the present article is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on the synergistic effects of heavy metal and pesticides in living systems. The information included in this article may be useful for different environment protection agencies and policy makers to consider the combined effects of heavy metals and pesticides on humans while designing strategies toward environmental protection and safety regulations about human health.},

  abstract = {There is no unified evidence base to help decision-makers understand how the multiple components of natural capital interact to deliver ecosystem services. We systematically reviewed 780 papers, recording how natural capital attributes (29 biotic attributes and 11 abiotic factors) affect the delivery of 13 ecosystem services. We develop a simple typology based on the observation that five main attribute groups influence the capacity of natural capital to provide ecosystem services, related to: A) the physical amount of vegetation cover; B) presence of suitable habitat to support species or functional groups that provide a service; C) characteristics of particular species or functional groups; D) physical and biological diversity; and E) abiotic factors that interact with the biotic factors in groups A–D. ‘Bundles’ of services can be identified that are governed by different attribute groups. Management aimed at maximising only one service often has negative impacts on other services and on biological and physical diversity. Sustainable ecosystem management should aim to maintain healthy, diverse and resilient ecosystems that can deliver a wide range of ecosystem services in the long term. This can maximise the synergies and minimise the trade-offs between ecosystem services and is also compatible with the aim of conserving biodiversity.},

The model is designed to simulate mobile source pollutant dispersion to support the assessment of human exposures in near-roadway environments where a significant portion of the population spends time. The model uses an efficient numerical integration scheme to integrate the contributions of point sources used to represent a line-source. Emphasis has been placed on estimates of concentrations very near to the source line. The near-surface dispersion algorithms are based on new formulations of horizontal and vertical dispersion within the atmospheric surface layer, details of which are described in a companion paper (Venkatram et~al., 2013). This paper describes the general formulations of the RLINE model, the meteorological inputs for the model, the numerical integration techniques, the handling of receptors close to the line source, and the performance of the model against developmental data bases and near-road concentrations from independent field studies conducted along actual highway segments.},

  abstract = {Adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution are a global challenge and of widespread concern. Recent high ambient concentration episodes of air pollutants in European cities highlighted the dynamic nature of human exposure and the gaps in data and knowledge about exposure patterns. In order to support health impact assessment it is essential to develop a better understanding of individual exposure pathways in people's everyday lives by taking account of all environments in which people spend time. Here we describe the development, validation and results of an exposure method applied in a study conducted in Scotland. A low-cost particle counter based on light-scattering technology — the Dylos 1700 was used. Its performance was validated in comparison with equivalent instruments (TEOM-FDMS) at two national monitoring network sites (R2=0.9 at a rural background site, R2=0.7 at an urban background site). This validation also provided two functions to convert measured PNCs into calculated particle mass concentrations for direct comparison of concentrations with equivalent monitoring instruments and air quality limit values. This study also used contextual and time-based activity data to define six microenvironments (MEs) to assess everyday exposure of individuals to short-term PM2.5 concentrations. The Dylos was combined with a GPS receiver to track movement and exposure of individuals across the MEs. Seventeen volunteers collected 35 profiles. Profiles may have a different overall duration and structure with respect to times spent in different MEs and activities undertaken. Results indicate that due to the substantial variability across and between MEs, it is essential to measure near-complete exposure pathways to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the exposure risk a person encounters on a daily basis. Taking into account the information gained through personal exposure measurements, this work demonstrates the added value of data generated by the application of low-cost monitors.},

  abstract = {In 1993, a large ({$>$}1000 monitoring sites) co-ordinated monitoring network for nitrogen dioxide, using diffusion tube samplers, was established in urban areas throughout the UK. The primary aim of this network is to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of NO2 throughout the UK and highlight areas of high concentration which may require more detailed monitoring with automatic analysers. This paper presents a summary of the results for the first 5-years of monitoring, 1993–1997 inclusive. The network has shown that highest concentrations occur in London and urban areas of Yorkshire and Humberside and the East and West Midlands of the UK. Averaged over the whole of the UK, NO2 concentrations have been remarkably similar for most of the 5 years, though a significant decrease was observed at urban background locations in 1997. Overall, average NO2 concentrations during 1997 were 23 ppb at kerbside locations and 13 ppb at urban background locations. The results of the network have been used by the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions as one of the criteria for the selection of priority areas for expansion of the UK Automatic Urban Network in recent years. Extensive quality assurance and control procedures incorporated into the network ensure that the estimated accuracy of the data is broadly comparable with the accuracy requirement for indicative monitoring specified in the EU “daughter” Directive for NO2(±25\%). The complete dataset of results for the network can be found on the world wide web at http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq/aqinfo.htm.},

  abstract = {Background/aim Epidemiological cohort studies have consistently found associations between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and a range of morbidity and mortality endpoints. Recent evaluations by World Health Organisation and Global Burden of Disease study suggested that these associations may be non-linear and persist at very low concentrations. Methods We focus on analyses contributing to knowledge about health effects of air pollution concentrations at low concentrations, defined as less than current EU, EPA and WHO Limit Values or guidelines for PM2.5, NO2 and O3. Studies have focused especially on PM2.5, but increasingly associations with NO2 are reported. Very few studies have evaluated long-term morbidity and mortality effects of O3.We perform analyses of all-cause and cause-specific mortality and morbidity endpoints in a pooled dataset of 10 ESCAPE study cohorts and the Danish Nurse Cohort with detailed individual data (\textasciitilde 3 80 000 subjects) and in seven very large European administrative cohorts (\textasciitilde 35 million subjects). We focus on PM2.5, NO2, O3, and exploit rich monitoring data of black carbon (BC) available from the ESCAPE study. Results The first results are expected mid 2018. So far, we completed exposure assessment – using hybrid LUR models we made European maps of 2010 concentrations for PM2.5, NO2, O3 and BC. As individual cohort data are pooled, we developed common codebook harmonising variables between cohorts. We also obtained additional residential addresses histories. Further, we developed data transfer and management procedures. Data from all cohorts has been transferred and checked. Follow up is extended until 2013. We established secure remote access environment so that analysts involved can perform analyses without physically travelling to Utrecht. Finally, common statistical analysis scripts have been developed and afterwards demonstrated and discussed during the Stat Workshop (Utrecht, 25–27 Oct 2017). Conclusion There are no conclusions yet from this study.},

  abstract = {Active travel (cycling, walking) is beneficial for the health due to increased physical activity (PA). However, active travel may increase the intake of air pollution, leading to negative health consequences. We examined the risk–benefit balance between active travel related PA and exposure to air pollution across a range of air pollution and PA scenarios. The health effects of active travel and air pollution were estimated through changes in all-cause mortality for different levels of active travel and air pollution. Air pollution exposure was estimated through changes in background concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ranging from 5 to 200μg/m3. For active travel exposure, we estimated cycling and walking from 0 up to 16h per day, respectively. These refer to long-term average levels of active travel and PM2.5 exposure. For the global average urban background PM2.5 concentration (22μg/m3) benefits of PA by far outweigh risks from air pollution even under the most extreme levels of active travel. In areas with PM2.5 concentrations of 100μg/m3, harms would exceed benefits after 1h 30min of cycling per day or more than 10h of walking per day. If the counterfactual was driving, rather than staying at home, the benefits of PA would exceed harms from air pollution up to 3h 30min of cycling per day. The results were sensitive to dose–response function (DRF) assumptions for PM2.5 and PA. PA benefits of active travel outweighed the harm caused by air pollution in all but the most extreme air pollution concentrations.},

  abstract = {Indoor dust acts as a media for heavy metal deposition. Past studies have shown that heavy metal concentration in indoor dust is affected by local human activities and atmospheric transport can have harmful effects on human health. Additionally, children are more sensitive to heavy metals due to their hand-to-mouth behaviour and rapid body development. However, limited information on health risks were found in past dust studies as these studies aimed to identify heavy metal concentrations and sources of indoor dust. The objective of this review is to discuss heavy metal concentration and sources influencing its concentration in indoor dust. Accordingly, high lead (Pb) concentration (639.10 μg/g) has been reported in heavy traffic areas. In addition, this review paper aims to estimate the health risk to children from heavy metals in indoor dust via multiple exposure pathways using the health-risk assessment (HRA). Urban areas and industrial sites have revealed high heavy metal concentration in comparison to rural areas. Hazard index (HI) values found in arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) and Pb were 21.30, 1.10 and 2.40, respectively, indicate that non-carcinogenic elements are found in children. Furthermore, most of the past studies have found that carcinogenic risks for As, cadmium (Cd), Cr and Pb were below the acceptable total lifetime cancer risk (TLCR) range (1×10-6-1×10-4). The results of health risk assessment in this review show that carcinogenic risk exists among children. Hence, this proves that future studies need to focus on children's carcinogenic risk in indoor dust studies in order to find out the sources of heavy metals in indoor dust. This review highlights the importance of having the HRA application using bioavailable heavy metal concentration as it provides more accurate health-risk estimation. Moreover, this review is also useful as a reference for policy decision making in protecting children's health.},

  abstract = {Aims Air particulate matter (PM) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Altered autonomic functions play a key role in PM-induced cardiovascular disease. However, previous studies have not address the impact of PM on sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart function, independently, and using controlled conditions, i.e., increasing titration of PM of known composition, in absence of other potential confounding factors. To fill this gap, here we used symbolic analysis that is capable of detecting non-mutual changes of the two autonomic branches, thus considering them as independent, and concentrations of PM as they could be measured at peak levels in Milan during a polluted winter day. Methods and results In this randomized, cross-over study, we enrolled 12 healthy subjects who underwent two random sessions: inhalation of filtered air mixture or inhalation of filtered air containing particulate mixture (PM 10, PM 2.5, PM 1.0 and PM 0.5µm). ECG and respiration for autonomic analysis and blood sample for DNA Methylation were collected at baseline (T1), after air exposure (T2) and after 2h (T3). Spectral and symbolic analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were performed for autonomic control of cardiac function, while alterations in DNA methylation of candidate genes were used to index pro-inflammatory modifications. In the PM expose group, autonomic analysis revealed a significant decrease of 2UV\%, index of parasympathetic modulation (14\% vs 9\%, p = 0.0309), while DNA analysis showed a significant increase of interferon γ (IFN- γ) methylation, from T1 to T3. In a mixed model using T1, T2 and T3, fine and ultrafine PM fractions showed significant associations with IFN- γ methylation and parasympathetic modulation. Conclusions Our study shows, for the first time, that in healthy subjects, acute exposure to PM affects parasympathetic control of heart function and it increases methylation of a pro-inflammatory gene (i.e. methylation of interferon γ). Thus, our study suggests that, even in absence of other co-factors and in otherwise healthy individuals, PM per se is sufficient to trigger parasympathetic dysautonomia, independently from changes in sympathetic control, and inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner.},

These comprised two inner city routes in Amsterdam (ICR 1 and 2) as well as a route including a tunnel on a busy highway (TR) and a rural route just south of Amsterdam (RR). A third inner city route, a busy narrow street, was subsequently also selected, and covered by bicycle or walking (ICR 3). Each run lasted about 1 h; the sampling time on the TR route was approximately 30min. The sampling periods in January and May lasted 2 weeks with four sampling days per week. In August only ICR 3 was covered, this sampling period lasted 2 days. CO, NO2, benzene, toluene and xylenes were measured in the personal air samples. A monitoring vehicle covered the routes concurrently and measured CO, NO2 and pm10 (semi) continuously. Lead and PAH content in pm10 was determined. The ventilation of the volunteers was measured while they were using a car or a bicycle. The route and the type of transport influenced (P {$<$} 0.001) the concentrations of CO, benzene, toluene and xylenes. The daily average temperature was positively associated with the exposure of car drivers and cyclists to most compounds measured. A volunteer exhaled on average 2.3 times more air as a cyclist than as a car driver. Despite the much higher concentrations in the personal air samples of car drivers, the uptake of CO, benzene, toluene and xylenes of cyclists sometimes approached that of the car drivers. The uptake of NO2 of cyclists was clearly higher than that of car drivers.},

  abstract = {Automatic monitoring networks have the ability of capturing air pollution episodes, as well as short- and long-term air quality trends in urban areas that can be used in epidemiological studies. However, due to practical constraints (e.g. cost and bulk of equipment), the use of automatic analysers is restricted to a limited number of roadside and background locations within a city. As a result, certain localised air pollution hotspots may be overlooked or overemphasised, especially near heavily trafficked street canyons and intersections. This has implications for compliance with regulatory standards and may cause exposure misclassification in epidemiological studies. Apart from automatic analysers, low cost passive diffusion tubes can be used to characterise the spatial variability of air pollution in urban areas. In this study, BTEX, NO2 and O3 data from a one-year passive sampling survey were used to characterise the intra-urban and street scale spatial variability of traffic-related pollutants in Birmingham (UK). In addition, continuous monitoring of NO2, NOx, O3, CO, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 from three permanent monitoring sites was used to identify seasonal and annual pollution patterns. The passive sampling measurements allowed us to evaluate the representativeness of a permanent roadside monitoring site that has recorded some of the highest NO2 and PM10 concentrations in Birmingham in recent years. Dispersion modelling was also used to gain further insight into pollutant sources and dispersion characteristics at this location. The strong spatial concentration gradients observed in busy streets, as well as the differences between roadside and urban background levels highlight the importance of appropriate positioning of air quality monitoring equipment in cities.},

  abstract = {Background The results of several studies conducted in the United States show no association between intake of 100 percent fruit juice and early childhood caries (ECC). The authors examined this association according to poverty and race/ethnicity among U.S. preschool children. Methods The authors analyzed data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2,290 children aged 2 through 5 years. They used logistic models for caries (yes or no) to assess the association between caries and intake of 100 percent fruit juice, defined as consumption (yes or no), ounces (categories) consumed in the previous 24 hours or usual intake (by means of a statistical method from the National Cancer Institute). Results The association between caries and consumption of 100 percent fruit juice (yes or no) was not statistically significant in an unadjusted logistic model (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.57-1.01), and it remained nonsignificant after covariate adjustment (OR, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.63-1.24). Similarly, models in which we evaluated categorical consumption of 100 percent juice (that is, 0 oz; {$>$} 0 and ≤ 6 oz; and {$>$} 6 oz), unadjusted and adjusted by covariates, did not indicate an association with ECC. Conclusions Our study findings are consistent with those of other studies that show consumption of 100 percent fruit juice is not associated with ECC. Practical Implications Dental practitioners should educate their patients and communities about the low risk of developing caries associated with consumption of 100 percent fruit juice. Limiting consumption of 100 percent fruit juice to 4 to 6 oz per day among children 1 through 5 years of age should be taught as part of general health education.},

  abstract = {The identification of similar entities represented by records in different databases has drawn considerable attention in many application areas, including in the health domain. One important type of entity matching application that is vital for quality healthcare analytics is the identification of similar patients, known as similar patient matching. A key component of identifying similar records is the calculation of similarity of the values in attributes (fields) between these records. Due to increasing privacy and confidentiality concerns, using the actual attribute values of patient records to identify similar records across different organizations is becoming non-trivial because the attributes in such records often contain highly sensitive information such as personal and medical details of patients. Therefore, the matching needs to be based on masked (encoded) values while being effective and efficient to allow matching of large databases. Bloom filter encoding has widely been used as an efficient masking technique for privacy-preserving matching of string and categorical values. However, no work on Bloom filter-based masking of numerical data, such as integer (e.g. age), floating point (e.g. body mass index), and modulus (numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value, e.g. date and time), which are commonly required in the health domain, has been presented in the literature. We propose a framework with novel methods for masking numerical data using Bloom filters, thereby facilitating the calculation of similarities between records. We conduct an empirical study on publicly available real-world datasets which shows that our framework provides efficient masking and achieves similar matching accuracy compared to the matching of actual unencoded patient records.},

  abstract = {Tetraethyl Lead (TEL) is an added substance in 100 Low Lead (100LL) (AVGAS) to help in detonation as detonation creates very high pressures inside the engine which can easily cause engine shutdown with major damages. Without the added substance of TEL, the octane levels would be too low for AVGAS, and utilisation of a lower octane fuel than required could prompt catastrophic engine failure as they work at higher power settings and temperatures. Friends of the Earth (FOE) documented a ''Petition for Rulemaking Seeking the Regulation of Lead Emissions from General Aviation Aircraft Under Clean Air Act" to make a finding that lead emissions from general aviation is harmful to the nature and human being. FOE suggested a proposed emission standard for lead from general aviation (GA) aircraft under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United States of America (USA) believes that insufficient information exists to make such a finding. EPA USA insists to commence a study and investigation of the health and environmental impacts of lead emissions from GA aircraft, including impacts to humans, animals and ecosystems under the CAA and issue a public report on the findings of the study and investigation. EPA in 2008, decreased the level of the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead from 1.5 µg/m3 to 0.15 µg/m3 in order to provide increased protection for children and other at-risk populations against an array of adverse health effects, most notably neurological effects in children, including neurocognitive and neurobehavioral effects. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center tested 245 fuels overseen by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) with 45 of the most promising blends were examined more closely in full-scale engine testing. None of the fuels could satisfy all the performance requirements of AVGAS 100LL for safe and reliable operations without further polluting the environment. In this study, a comprehensive review will be conducted to analyse serious concerns raised by the lead emissions caused by the GA aircrafts using AVGAS 100LL as the fuel. Concerns of EDB exposure, TEL exposure, health issues, at-risk populations and life stages, terrestrial eco-system issues, aquatic eco-system issues, societal and economic impacts, operational safety issues, inadequate lead emissions inventory and limited data on lead monitoring. The findings of this review suggest the seriousness of finding an unleaded alternative fuel for environmental sustainability with the fact that lead emissions should also be given equal concentration with proper studies and findings to help in the elimination efforts as per serious concerns given to emissions of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and other particulates emissions in aviation},

  abstract = {Asthma ranks among the most costly of chronic diseases, accounting for over \$50 billion annually in direct medical expenditures in the United States. At the same time, evidence has accumulated that fine particulate matter pollution can exacerbate asthma symptoms and generate substantial economic costs. To measure these costs, we use a unique nationwide panel dataset tracking asthmatic individuals’ use of rescue medication and their exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of {$<$}2.5 μm) concentration between 2012 and 2017, to estimate the causal relationship between pollution and inhaler use. Our sample consists of individuals using an asthma digital health platform, which relies on a wireless sensor to track the place and time of inhaler use events, as well as regular nonevent location and time indicators. These data provide an accurate measurement of inhaler use and allow spatially and temporally resolute assignment of pollution exposure. Using a high-frequency research design and individual fixed effects, we find that a 1 μg/m3 (12\%) increase in weekly exposure to PM2.5 increases weekly inhaler use by 0.82\%. We also show that there is seasonal, regional, and income-based heterogeneity in this response. Using our response prediction, and an estimate from the literature on the willingness to pay to avoid asthma symptoms, we show that a nationwide 1 μg/m3 reduction in particulate matter concentration would generate nearly \$350 million annually in economic benefits.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Objectives: United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill tens of thousands of Americans. Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM\textsubscript{2.5}) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98\% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM\textsubscript{2.5} as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 μg/m\textsuperscript{3} in PM\textsubscript{2.5} is associated with an 8\% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2\%, 15\%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM\textsubscript{2.5} leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Lead is a neurotoxin with developmentally harmful effects in children. In the United States, over half the current flow of lead into the atmosphere is attribut- able to lead-formulated aviation gasoline (avgas), used in a large fraction of piston- engine aircraft. Various public interest firms have petitioned the EPA to find endan- germent from and regulate lead emitted by piston-engine aircraft, though the EPA has so far ruled against such petitions. To address an EPA request for more evidence, we construct a novel data set that links time and spatially referenced blood lead data from over a million children to 448 nearby airports in Michigan. Across a series of tests, and adjusting for other known sources of lead exposure, we find that child blood lead levels (1) increase dose-responsively in proximity to airports, (2) decline measurably among children sampled in the months after 9/11, (3) increase dose- responsively in the flow of piston-engine aircraft traffic, (4) increase in the percentage of prevailing wind days drifting in the direction of a child’s residential location, and (5) behave intuitively and significantly when considering two-way and three-way in- teractions of our main treatment variables. To quantify the policy relevance of the results we provide a conservative estimate of the social damages attributable to avgas consumption. Damages are at least \$10 per gallon, which can be compared to a pump price of about \$6 per gallon.}

  abstract = {Background Commuters are exposed to high concentrations of air pollutants, but little quantitative information is currently available on differences in exposure between different modes of transport, routes, and fuel types. Objectives The aim of our study was to assess differences in commuters’ exposure to traffic-related air pollution related to transport mode, route, and fuel type. Methods We measured particle number counts (PNCs) and concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter), PM10, and soot between June 2007 and June 2008 on 47 weekdays, from 0800 to 1000 hours, in diesel and electric buses, gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars, and along two bicycle routes with different traffic intensities in Arnhem, the Netherlands. In addition, each-day measurements were taken at an urban background location. Results We found that median PNC exposures were highest in diesel buses (38,500 particles/cm3) and for cyclists along the high-traffic intensity route (46,600 particles/cm3) and lowest in electric buses (29,200 particles/cm3). Median PM10 exposure was highest from diesel buses (47 μg/m3) and lowest along the high- and low-traffic bicycle routes (39 and 37 μg/m3). The median soot exposure was highest in gasoline-fueled cars (9.0 × 10−5/m), diesel cars (7.9 × 10−5/m), and diesel buses (7.4 × 10−5/m) and lowest along the low-traffic bicycle route (4.9 × 10−5/m). Because the minute ventilation (volume of air per minute) of cyclists, which we estimated from measured heart rates, was twice the minute ventilation of car and bus passengers, we calculated that the inhaled air pollution doses were highest for cyclists. With the exception of PM10, we found that inhaled air pollution doses were lowest for electric bus passengers. Conclusions Commuters’ rush hour exposures were significantly influenced by mode of transport, route, and fuel type.},

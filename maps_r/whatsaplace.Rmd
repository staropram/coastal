What is a coastal town? It sounds like a simple question to answer and probably one which conjours up specific place names in the mind of the reader: St Ives, Scarborough, Witby, Portree, Herne Bay, etc. But what can a place name tell us about a town? Let us consider Herne Bay in Kent as an example as it serves to illustrate the hidden complexity underlying this seemingly simple question.

Ordnance Survey maintains a list of place names in a product called "OS Open Names" [@OrdnanceSurvey2023] which is free to use.

But what can we really learn about a place solely from its name? Whatever is recorded in association with that name.
